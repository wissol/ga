\section{Pruebas}

Una prueba\index{prueba} permite determinar si un personaje ha tenido éxito o ha fracasado en su intento de realizar una acción.

\begin{enumerate}
\item El jugador explica al máster la acción que su personaje está intentando.
\item El máster determina las posibles consecuencias de la acción y, si es necesario, se las explica al jugador. Por ejemplo, si un \textsc{pj} intenta disparar a una rata con un tirachinas las consecuencias podrían ser un fallo o un acierto, con el consiguiente herida para la rata.
\item El máster determina luego qué atributo es el más apropiado para la acción.
\item Número objetivo\index{número objetivo}
\item ¿Subir y bajar?
\end{enumerate}


% \subsection{Choosing the skill and the dice}

% Basic checks%
% \footnote{Also known as skill tests.%
% } allow us to know whether a character has been successful when attempting
% an action. It is one of the most used rules in every game session,
% so pay attention.
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Make sure you know what \emph{action} the player character is attempting
% and what the \emph{consequences} of that action could be. For example:
% if a player shoots a rat with his slingshot, the action would be shooting
% and the possible consequences are either a hit or a miss -- and the
% effects of that hit. The game master might want to ask the player
% to make sure he understands what he's trying to do.
% \item The game master is the only one who can determine the consequences
% of any attempted action. 
% \item The game master then determines which \emph{skill} is more appropriate
% for the \emph{action} being attempted%
% \footnote{Shooting is appropriate when the action is shooting a rat with your
% slingshot. Academics is appropriate for reading.%
% }. 
% \item \emph{If there's no appropriate skill}, the game master should choose
% an \emph{attribute} instead%
% \footnote{Suppose a newsboy finds one of the first photographic inventions and
% wants to take a picture of his friends. There is no skill for photography
% so the game master might decide that you use your Education attribute
% for this action.%
% }. Again, the game master's decision is final.
% \item Use the dice of the attribute linked to the skill, \emph{upgrading}
% or\emph{ downgrading} them:

% \begin{itemize}
% \item If the character is \emph{good at} the appropriate skill, upgrade
% the dice of the linked attribute. Weak dice become normal dice (OK
% dice), while normal dice become swell dice. 
% \item If the character is \emph{bad at} the appropriate skill, downgrade
% the dice of the linked attribute. Weak dice become fool dice and normal
% dice become weak dice. 
% \item If the character is \emph{OK at} the appropriate skill, use the dice
% of the linked attribute without any modifications.
% \end{itemize}
% \end{enumerate}
% \begin{description}
% \item [{Example:}] \emph{Allan is }good at\emph{ Sweet Talk, a skill linked
% to the Charisma attribute. He has four weak dice in his Charisma attribute.
% When he tries any Sweet Talk action, such as asking a bootblack girl
% for a date, he upgrades those four weak dice to four normal dice.}
% \end{description}

% \subsection{The target number}

% The game master then determines a target number (TN). If the player
% rolls equal or higher than the target number, he succeeds. If he rolls
% less than the target number, he fails. A task of average difficulty
% will demand a TN of 10, a very easy task could use a TN of 4, while
% a difficult task can only be achieved with a TN of 14 or more. (Refer
% to 3.2.2.1 Target Number Table.)
% \begin{description}
% \item [{Example:}] Suppose Rick is shooting a can with a slingshot. Since
% Shooting is the appropriate skill for this, the game master chooses
% it to carry out the action. Shooting is linked to Eyes \& Ears. Rick's
% character sheet shows that he has three weak dice in Eyes \& Ears;
% not so good. Yet, Rick is also \emph{good at} Shooting, so he upgrades
% those three weak dice to normal dice. The game master announces that
% hitting the can will require a TN of 11 because it's quite far away.
% Rick rolls his three normal dice and gets a 13, hitting the can right
% in the middle with a satisfying noise, watching as it falls and rolls
% along the pavement. Had Rick been \emph{bad at} Shooting, he would
% have had a problem because he would have downgraded his weak dice
% to fool dice. It's hard to roll an 11 with three fool dice unless
% you use some chits%
% \footnote{Chits are discussed in Chapter \vref{cha:Chits} %
% }. If Rick had been neither \emph{good at} or \emph{bad at} Shooting,
% he would have used the three weak dice of his Agility score and had
% some chance of hitting the can.
% \end{description}

% \subsubsection*{When to not roll dice}

% If the game master is sure you will succeed (or fail), you don't have
% to roll any dice. To speed up the game, the game master may decide
% that a player character (not a non-player character) automatically
% succeeds at an easy task. Reserve rolling dice for the important stuff
% only. This is how it goes:
% \begin{description}
% \item [{Impossible~Tasks:}] The attempt is genuinely impossible, such
% as flapping your arms to fly. The attempt fails automatically, whether
% the dice is rolled or the chits are spent.
% \item [{Trivial~Tasks:}] These are so easy, you are guaranteed to succeed.
% The game master does not need to require a die roll, except if the
% task is attempted under stress such as during a fight or in an emergency.
% \item [{Very~Easy~Tasks:}] The game master may decide that the player
% character succeeds automatically, except if the task is attempted
% under stress such as during a fight or in an emergency.
% \end{description}

% \subsubsection{Target Number Table}

% This table is a guideline for the game master when he has to determine
% a target number. You can use a TN of 5 or 7 if you think that would
% be the most appropriate for any given situation%
% \footnote{Note that average (normal) difficulty means average for an adult without
% special training. Dressing a wound would be of average difficulty
% using the Healing skill. In any case, these guidelines are not the
% Bible. The game master can change this table or disregard it altogether.%

% \end{wrapfigure}%
% \lettrine{S}{}ome friends are sitting at a table; one of them is
% the game master, the rest are the players, each one playing the role
% of a player character. The game master describes the scene:

% \emph{``You enter the alley with soft feet and wild hearts, trembling
% at what could be waiting for you among the shadows. The air is filled
% with the stench of the putrid fruit piled against a corner. What could
% be hiding behind it? Ghosts are supposed to exist only in fairy tales,
% but right now you aren't so sure. Was that a step you heard? Tell
% me, what are you going to do?\textquotedbl{}}

% \emph{Rick, one of the player characters, decides to take the lead.
% ``I am going to shoot at the fruit pile with my slingshot and if
% anything moves, I say we run away like crazy.\textquotedbl{}}

% \emph{If the game master is sure about the success of an action he
% grants a success and that's that; no dice required. If on the other
% hand, the action is believed impossible, the game master forbids it. }

% \emph{In this case the game master is sure that Rick can't miss hitting
% the fruit pile. He answers ``OK, Rick\textquotedbl{}. You point and
% shoot and the stone hits the rotting fruit pile. After a split second,
% you all see a ferocious, rabid cat emerging from the fruit pile, foam
% coming out of its mouth. Now tell me, what are you going to do?\textquotedbl{}}

% \emph{The group's answer is unanimous: ``Run for it!\textquotedbl{}
% Perhaps the game master is exaggerating a bit on his description of
% the cat, but they aren't taking any chances with a rabid feline.}

% Now the game master has a small problem; will the players be able
% to outrun the cat through the maze of trash-ridden alleys? That's
% why we have rules. They help you to decide who can do what and what
% the results of those actions could be, striving to be fair, fast and
% fun.


% \section{Basic checks}


% \subsection{Choosing the skill and the dice}

% Basic checks%
% \footnote{Also known as skill tests.%
% } allow us to know whether a character has been successful when attempting
% an action. It is one of the most used rules in every game session,
% so pay attention.
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Make sure you know what \emph{action} the player character is attempting
% and what the \emph{consequences} of that action could be. For example:
% if a player shoots a rat with his slingshot, the action would be shooting
% and the possible consequences are either a hit or a miss -- and the
% effects of that hit. The game master might want to ask the player
% to make sure he understands what he's trying to do.
% \item The game master is the only one who can determine the consequences
% of any attempted action. 
% \item The game master then determines which \emph{skill} is more appropriate
% for the \emph{action} being attempted%
% \footnote{Shooting is appropriate when the action is shooting a rat with your
% slingshot. Academics is appropriate for reading.%
% }. 
% \item \emph{If there's no appropriate skill}, the game master should choose
% an \emph{attribute} instead%
% \footnote{Suppose a newsboy finds one of the first photographic inventions and
% wants to take a picture of his friends. There is no skill for photography
% so the game master might decide that you use your Education attribute
% for this action.%
% }. Again, the game master's decision is final.
% \item Use the dice of the attribute linked to the skill, \emph{upgrading}
% or\emph{ downgrading} them:

% \begin{itemize}
% \item If the character is \emph{good at} the appropriate skill, upgrade
% the dice of the linked attribute. Weak dice become normal dice (OK
% dice), while normal dice become swell dice. 
% \item If the character is \emph{bad at} the appropriate skill, downgrade
% the dice of the linked attribute. Weak dice become fool dice and normal
% dice become weak dice. 
% \item If the character is \emph{OK at} the appropriate skill, use the dice
% of the linked attribute without any modifications.
% \end{itemize}
% \end{enumerate}
% \begin{description}
% \item [{Example:}] \emph{Allan is }good at\emph{ Sweet Talk, a skill linked
% to the Charisma attribute. He has four weak dice in his Charisma attribute.
% When he tries any Sweet Talk action, such as asking a bootblack girl
% for a date, he upgrades those four weak dice to four normal dice.}
% \end{description}

% \subsection{The target number}

% The game master then determines a target number (TN). If the player
% rolls equal or higher than the target number, he succeeds. If he rolls
% less than the target number, he fails. A task of average difficulty
% will demand a TN of 10, a very easy task could use a TN of 4, while
% a difficult task can only be achieved with a TN of 14 or more. (Refer
% to 3.2.2.1 Target Number Table.)
% \begin{description}
% \item [{Example:}] Suppose Rick is shooting a can with a slingshot. Since
% Shooting is the appropriate skill for this, the game master chooses
% it to carry out the action. Shooting is linked to Eyes \& Ears. Rick's
% character sheet shows that he has three weak dice in Eyes \& Ears;
% not so good. Yet, Rick is also \emph{good at} Shooting, so he upgrades
% those three weak dice to normal dice. The game master announces that
% hitting the can will require a TN of 11 because it's quite far away.
% Rick rolls his three normal dice and gets a 13, hitting the can right
% in the middle with a satisfying noise, watching as it falls and rolls
% along the pavement. Had Rick been \emph{bad at} Shooting, he would
% have had a problem because he would have downgraded his weak dice
% to fool dice. It's hard to roll an 11 with three fool dice unless
% you use some chits%
% \footnote{Chits are discussed in Chapter \vref{cha:Chits} %
% }. If Rick had been neither \emph{good at} or \emph{bad at} Shooting,
% he would have used the three weak dice of his Agility score and had
% some chance of hitting the can.
% \end{description}

% \subsubsection*{When to not roll dice}

% If the game master is sure you will succeed (or fail), you don't have
% to roll any dice. To speed up the game, the game master may decide
% that a player character (not a non-player character) automatically
% succeeds at an easy task. Reserve rolling dice for the important stuff
% only. This is how it goes:
% \begin{description}
% \item [{Impossible~Tasks:}] The attempt is genuinely impossible, such
% as flapping your arms to fly. The attempt fails automatically, whether
% the dice is rolled or the chits are spent.
% \item [{Trivial~Tasks:}] These are so easy, you are guaranteed to succeed.
% The game master does not need to require a die roll, except if the
% task is attempted under stress such as during a fight or in an emergency.
% \item [{Very~Easy~Tasks:}] The game master may decide that the player
% character succeeds automatically, except if the task is attempted
% under stress such as during a fight or in an emergency.
% \end{description}

% \subsubsection{Target Number Table}

% This table is a guideline for the game master when he has to determine
% a target number. You can use a TN of 5 or 7 if you think that would
% be the most appropriate for any given situation%
% \footnote{Note that average (normal) difficulty means average for an adult without
% special training. Dressing a wound would be of average difficulty
% using the Healing skill. In any case, these guidelines are not the
% Bible. The game master can change this table or disregard it altogether.%

% \bottomrule
% \end{longtable}




% \subsection{The fumble }

% You fumble when you roll seven points lower than your target number,
% or you roll a 1 with each and every one of your dice%
% \footnote{It's a good thing that swell dice do not have any 1s. Plus, if you
% have three weak dice in Education and you are \emph{good at} Academics,
% it would be unlikely for you to fumble unless you face a difficult
% task.%
% }.

% A fumble could not mean anything more serious than making a fool of
% yourself before your friends; falling off your bike, tripping, or
% answering to your teacher that King George the Fifth was the first
% U.S. President. However, it could have very dear consequences, especially
% when running away from a ghost or in a fight, so avoid attempting
% actions where you could easily fumble.


% \subsection{The fail}

% You fail when you roll lower than your target number, but yet not
% so bad as in a fumble.

% A fail means you have not achieved your desired goals. If you fail
% attacking somebody in a fight, you just miss your enemy, if you fumble,
% your own strength could make you fall down, face first. Still, failing
% can be tragic in some situations, like if you are trying to jump from
% one window to the next.


% \subsection{The success}

% You achieve success when you roll equal or higher than your target
% number, but yet you do not get a spectacular success.

% A success means you have reached your desired goals, which in most
% cases would be good enough.


% \subsection{The spectacular success}

% The spectacular success is the opposite of the fumble. \emph{You get
% a spectacular success }when you roll seven points\emph{ }over the
% target number\emph{, or you roll a 6 with each and every one of your
% dice}.

% A spectacular success gives you additional benefits; you'll sell newspapers
% much faster (giving you time to do something else or just sell more
% papers), you don't only know about George Washington, but you can
% tell your teacher the size of his shoes. In an emergency, a spectacular
% success could save the day.


% \subsubsection*{In short}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item The player tells the game master what action his character is attempting.
% \item The game master determines the appropriate skill to carry out that
% action. If there is no appropriate skill, he chooses an attribute.
% \item If the character is \emph{good at} the skill, he upgrades%
% \footnote{Normal dice become swell dice and weak dice become normal dice.%
% } the dice of his linked attribute. 
% \item If the character is \emph{bad at} the skill, he downgrades%
% \footnote{Normal dice become weak dice and weak dice become fool dice.%
% } the dice of his linked attribute.
% \item If the character is not \emph{OK at }the skill or is using an attribute,
% he rolls the dice of the linked attribute without upgrading or downgrading
% them.
% \item The game master determines the target number of the action as he sees
% fit%
% \footnote{A TN of 10 is average, 14 is very hard and 6 is very easy.%
% }. 
% \item The player rolls his dice, adding the results. He succeeds if the
% total is equal to or greater than the target number, and fails if
% the total is less than the target number.
% \item If the total is 7 points less than the TN or all your dice show 1s,
% it's a fumble.
% \item If the total is 7 points greater than the TN or all your dice show
% 6s, it's a spectacular success.
% \item Fumbles carry additional penalties, while a spectacular success provides
% extra benefits.
% \end{itemize}

% \section{Competitive tasks}

% Now you know how to test if a character succeeds at any given task.
% You ask the game master for a target number, you roll your dice, add
% them up, and if you get as much as the target number or higher, you
% succeed. What if two or more characters are competing to achieve the
% same task? 

% We could be trying to see who can run faster or sell the last newspaper
% to the last client of the day. Each character rolls his dice and the
% highest result wins. If two or more characters roll the same result
% they perform equally well.

% If the task was hard enough without competition, the game master might
% assign a minimum target number. If no character achieves this minimum
% they all fail. 
% \begin{quote}
% Let's suppose Tim and Pip are both taking an examination for the chance
% to earn a scholarship at the New Paris Atelier School of Arts. There's
% only one remaining scholarship and the school demands a minimum level
% of skill for admittance. The game master determines both competitors
% will need a TN of 15 or greater. Should they both fail, none of them
% will receive the scholarship. 
% \end{quote}
% Those who fumble (TN - 7), lose automatically. Those who roll a spectacular
% success (TN + 7), double their total. 


% \subsubsection*{In short}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item For a competitive task, every character rolls his dice and the highest
% total wins. 
% \item The game master \emph{may} assign a minimum target number.
% \item A fumble will lose automatically, while a spectacular success will
% double the totals.
% \item If both characters fail or fumble, there will be no winner.
% \end{itemize}

% \section{With a little help from my friends}

% What if two or more characters are trying to help each other to achieve
% the same task? First of all, the game master must make sure that teamwork
% does indeed help in the given situation. Athletics or shooting are
% examples of skills that are often individual in nature, while lifting
% a carriage from the body of an unfortunate newsboy does indeed benefit
% from as many arms as possible.

% The game master determines the target number and one of the characters
% is chosen to be the leader. The other characters are considered assistants.
% The leader rolls his dice normally. The assistants roll theirs too,
% but their results are halved, rounded up, and they then add all their
% points to the grand total.

% The game master may also assign a maximum number of helpers. 
% \begin{quote}
% Let's say that Tim and Pip are carrying a huge basket filled with
% eggs, hopefully without breaking any. The game master determines this
% is a feat of Strength and assigns a TN of 10. That's bad news for
% Tim (STR two weak dice) and Pip (STR two weak dice), so they decide
% to cooperate. Tim is chosen to be the leader and he rolls a 5 and
% a 3, for a total of 8. Pip, the helper, rolls a 4 + 3 = 7, halved
% to 3.5, rounded up to 4. The grand total is 8 + 4 = 12, which is greater
% than the TN of 10, so they succeed.
% \end{quote}

% \subsubsection*{Fumble and spectacular success}

% Any player who rolls a 1 on all of his dice causes the whole group
% to fumble. The group can also fumble if the grand total is 7 under
% the target number.

% The group achieves a spectacular success if the grand total is 7 over
% the target number, or if the leader rolls a 6 with all their dice
% and nobody fumbles; if anybody fumbles, the whole group fumbles.


% \subsubsection*{In short}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item The game master must agree that the task can be done in a group.
% \item One of the characters is chosen to be the leader, the rest are considered
% assistants.
% \item The leader rolls his dice and adds them up normally.
% \item The assistants roll their dice, but totals are halved and rounded
% up.
% \item Add the leader's and the assistants' rolls to find the grand total.
% \item If the grand total is equal to or greater than the target number,
% the group succeeds.
% \item If anybody fumbles, the whole group fumbles.
% \item If the grand total is lower than the TN - 7, it's a fumble.
% \item If the grand total is greater than the TN + 7, it's a spectacular
% success.
% \end{itemize}

% \section{Quick and dirty or slow and neat}

% The game assumes that most tasks are instantaneous or can be accomplished
% in less than two minutes. However, there are actions that require
% time, which is in short supply in an adventure. What then? The game
% master assigns a time frame to the action, according to his own good
% sense. If the player wants to speed up their action \emph{just a little
% bit} the game master should raise the TN by 1. If the player wants
% to do the action in half the time, the game master should double the
% target number.

% If the players are happy with slowing down their actions \emph{just
% a little bit} the game master may lower the TN by 1. If the players
% want to act slowly and safely the game master should lower the TN
% by 3.
% \begin{quote}
% \begin{onehalfspace}
% Suppose the players need to know how much time it would take them
% to do their homework%
% \footnote{Normally, a player doesn't roll for doing homework, but these players
% are trying to get to college eventually, so they want great grades.%
% } for the Newsboy Lodge Night School. The game master decides that
% it would normally take two hours. The players are not happy about
% that, so they ask to speed up that time by one third for a final time
% of one hour and 20 minutes. The game master thus determines that normally
% to get an A in that homework they would require a TN of 8, but since
% they are speeding up, he raises the TN by 1 to a total of 9.\end{onehalfspace}

% \end{quote}

% \subsubsection*{In short}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item If the players want to speed up their actions \emph{just a little
% bit} the game master should raise the TN by 1. 
% \item If the players want to act in half the time, the game master should
% double the target number.
% \item If the players are happy with slowing down their actions \emph{just
% a little bit} the game master may lower the TN by 1. 
% \item If the players want to act slow and safe the game master should lower
% the TN by 5.
% \end{itemize}

% \section{Try again}

% Most actions can be attempted more than once. In each case the game
% master must be satisfied that the characters still have the time,
% the materials and any other requirement. You can't try again with
% a fine Chinese vase that fell down, rolled and broke into smithereens.
% You can try again with a drawing that went wrong, provided you have
% a pencil and an eraser. 

% The game master will choose to use the same target number from the
% first attempt \emph{unless there is a good reason} to change it. A
% second or third attempt at escaping from the watch of kidnappers will
% be harder as the criminals will have been alerted. On the other hand,
% a second attempt at solving a mathematics question should be easier.

% However, if you try again but fail, you must pay 1 chit for the opportunity
% to attempt that same task again. 
% \begin{quote}
% Let's say Bobby is trying to pick the lock of a door to a room where
% he is locked in. Unfortunately, he's \emph{bad at} Locks and has only
% two weak dice in Agility. Since he is \emph{bad at} Locks his two
% weak dice are downgraded to two fool dice. The game master asks him
% for a TN of 8; difficult with just two fool dice. The player decides
% to try again and the game master concedes he has a better chance to
% pick the lock now that he's familiar with it, and lowers the TN to
% 7. Poor Bobby rolls his dice again and fails. Now, Bobby has heard
% that the corpse with whom he shares the room where he's locked in,
% is from Transylvania and he does not want to risk any legends of vampires.
% So, he pays 1 chit for another go with a TN lowered to 6. This time
% he succeeds%
% \footnote{As you will learn in Chapter \vref{cha:Chits}, Bobby could have used
% 1 chit for a re-roll in any of his earlier attempts. He chose not
% to do so because it was 9 a.m. (when a vampire sleeps), and he needed
% to lower the target number.%
% }. 
% \end{quote}
% Make sure the players understand that to try again is not the same
% as re-rolling. When you re-roll, you are rolling your dice again for
% the same action. If you try again you are making a new attempt%
% \footnote{If the characters doing their homework in the earlier example decided
% to try again, they would have had to erase everything they'd already
% done and start over.%
% }.


% \subsubsection*{In short}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item When a character wants to try again, he attempts a task that he has
% already tried and failed at.
% \item The game master must be assured that the action is still possible. 
% \item Have the characters used up the materials, tools and fuel, etc.?
% \item The game master can adjust the target number of the action if any
% successive attempt makes the action harder or easier.
% \item If the player fails three times in a row, he must pay 1 chit for the
% opportunity to have a fourth attempt.
% \end{itemize}

% \section{Fallen dice}

% Any die that falls off the table \emph{when testing for a skill or
% attribute} is read as a 1. Both players and the game master should
% be careful when throwing their dice, for their own benefit.


% \section{Detailed skill list}

% As promised, here is the detailed skill list, organized by each skill's
% linked attribute%
% \footnote{There are no skills linked to Health.%
% }. This list provides reference and guidelines for the game master
% and players, so you don't have to memorize it%
% \footnote{Please note that the Language skill works differently. In fact, it's
% so special it has its own section.%
% }.


% \subsection{Strength skills}
% \begin{description}
% \item [{Fisticuffs\,(STR):}] Fisticuffs is the appropriate skill to use
% when you get into a fight, as long as you fight with your own body
% or use hand weapons such as a stick or a sword. You can use this skill
% in a friendly wrestling competition or while mock boxing. Don't use
% this skill for throwing a stone or using a slingshot. That action
% is better reserved for Throwing and Shooting.\\
% You can usually try again as long as you are not in a fight. However,
% make each attempt harder by raising the TN by 1 if you don't rest
% for at least five minutes.%
% \footnote{You'll find more details on how to use Strength in Chapter \vref{cha:Fights,-Chases-and}%
% }
% \item [{Throwing\,(STR):}] Throwing is the skill of choice when you are
% throwing anything, either a carefully crafted javelin or throwing
% a knife to the most humble stone. \\
% You can try again as long as you don't run out of objects to throw.
% \end{description}

% \subsection{Agility skills}
% \begin{description}
% \item [{Athletics\,(AGI):}] Athletics is the appropriate skill for any
% action dealing with a sport or similar activity, not already covered
% by more specific skills such as Climbing or Riding. So, when a character
% is trying to climb a wall, play baseball or football, or jump over
% a fence, this skill would, under most circumstances, be helpful.\\
% A fumble in this skill can mean that you trip over yourself, perhaps
% suffering a few cuts and bruises%
% \footnote{See the Damage Table \vpageref{sub:TDamage-Scale.}%
% }.\\
% Athletics is also appropriate when the characters are trying to run
% away from a criminal on foot, when participating in a race with their
% friends, or when trying to arrive on time to catch the Elevated Train
% or Subway. \\
% You can usually try again unless you are involved in a competition.
% \item [{Climbing\,(AGI):}] Climbing might be your last hope of escape
% when cornered in a narrow alley. It's also useful when trying to sneak
% into (or out of) a building, and to survive the most treacherous passages
% of the New Paris sewers.\\
% You can usually try again as long as you are not in a fight, but make
% each attempt harder by raising the TN by 1 if you don't rest for at
% least five minutes.
% \item [{Dodging\,(AGI):}] Dodging is an ability mostly used in a fight
% to avoid being hit, as discussed in Chapter \vref{cha:Fights,-Chases-and},
% but it can also come in handy to avoid being run over by a train,
% carriage or a horse. \\
% You cannot try again to dodge the same attack.
% \item [{Locks\,(AGI):}] This skill comprises the ability to open locks
% and safes, \emph{provided you have the proper tools}. Opening the
% door of a poor tenement house is relatively easy, requiring a TN of
% 12. A basic safety lock requires at least a TN of 13; a safe would
% require at least a TN of 15. With improvised tools, increase the TN
% by 3 to a total of 5.\\
% A fumble means you have damaged your tools, making them unusable even
% after they are properly repaired. You can usually try again unless
% you don't fumble.
% \item [{Pickpockets\,(AGI):}] This skill is useful for the obvious task
% of stealing wallets, watches and expensive handkerchiefs while the
% poor victim doesn't notice. Stealing from an unwary old lady should
% demand a TN of 12, but who would be such a crook? However, stealing
% from a wary policeman commands a TN of 16 or more. For other victims,
% the game master should use his good sense.\\
% A failure in this task indicates that the victim notices before you
% get to steal anything. 
% \item [{Riding\,(AGI):}] Riding includes the capacity to drive a bicycle,
% for example, and the ability to maintain it. The Mechanics skill (not
% Crafts) is also adequate to care for a bicycle, but not to ride it.
% As with Climbing and Athletics, a fumble in this skill will usually
% mean that you fall off your bike, perhaps suffering a few cuts and
% bruises. \\
% You can usually try again unless you are involved in a competition
% or you are being chased.
% \item [{Stealth\,(AGI):}] This skill comes in handy when playing hide-and-seek,
% especially if the one who seeks you is little Pete and his pet Rottweiler.
% In short, it's good for both hiding and moving silently without being
% detected. \\
% You cannot usually try again once you've been discovered.
% \item [{Swimming\,(AGI):}] Only characters who are \emph{good at }Swimming
% may swim in relatively calm waters without having to roll for this
% skill. Everybody else must roll for Swimming when they are swimming
% in water deeper than their height, with a TN of 8 for rough waters.
% \\
% Failure means that the player character cannot advance and must struggle
% to keep himself afloat. \\
% A fumble puts the character in immediate danger of drowning. In this
% case, the player character must struggle for his life, rolling once
% every minute. Any further failure means the player character would
% drown in five minutes, unless rescued. 
% \item [{Vehicles\,(AGI):}] The Vehicles skill is useful to operate and
% maintain any land vehicle except a bicycle. This includes trains and
% stagecoaches, but not riding a horse.\\
% You can try again unless you are being chased or are undertaking some
% competition.
% \end{description}

% \subsection{Education skills}
% \begin{description}
% \item [{Academics\,(EDU):}] Academics is a glorified term for school stuff.
% History, Biology, Botanics, Philosophy and in general, all school,
% high school and university subjects not covered by more specific skills
% belong to Academics. Use this skill when a character wants to know
% the meaning of some word, the poisonous effects of some plant or do
% research in a library. \\
% You can \emph{only} try agai'' if \emph{your character} is aware
% that he has failed, he can consult reference works, or ask a learned
% person such as a teacher.
% \item [{Crafts\,(EDU)~and~Mechanics\,(EDU):}] Crafts covers all sorts
% of traditional crafts, maintenance and repairs not related to electricity
% or mechanics; sewing, carpentry, masonry, drawing, painting, etc.,
% are covered by this skill. Crafts can be a pretty useful skill in
% the hands of the right player, provided there are enough tools, materials
% and time available. Repairing a train engine or some new wonder of
% science such as a horseless carriage is covered by Mechanics.\\
% A fumble at any of these skills lowers the quality of the item by
% one level.%
% \footnote{B-grade clothes downgrade to C, C-grade to D, D-grade to E and with
% E, well, you better get a barrel or something.%
% }\\
% You can usually try again as long as the materials are not used up
% by the attempt%
% \footnote{You can try again as long as you have paper or an eraser handy.%
% }. 
% \item [{Healing\,(EDU):}] Healing covers everything from dressing the
% leg of a puppy to minor surgery. Full details on how to use this skill
% are covered on \vref{sub:Healing} 
% \item [{Streetwise\,(EDU):}] Streetwise makes you aware of the places
% and people you ought to know (or avoid) in New Paris.\\
% You can't usually try again with this skill; if you don't know, then
% you don't know.
% \end{description}

% \subsection{Eyes \& Ears skills}
% \begin{description}
% \item [{Observation\,(E\&E):}] Observation is a great skill to discover
% someone trying to hide from you, trying to read a note in the dark
% or recognizing a face among the crowd.
% \item [{Shooting\,(E\&E):}] Shooting includes the skill to use and maintain
% any weapon that shoots a missile of some sort.
% \end{description}

% \subsection{Charisma skills}
% \begin{description}
% \item [{Performance\,(CHA):}] Being \emph{good at} Performance helps you
% to perform on the streets for a few dimes, juggle or even run a puppet
% show for children. 
% \item [{Languages\,(CHA):}] Languages is in fact, two skills in one: a)
% how many languages you know well enough to have a basic conversation;
% and b) communicating through mime and gestures. Note that standard
% sign language is considered a language; not mime and gestures.\\
% A character who is \emph{good at} Languages is entitled to test this
% skill the first time he needs to use a foreign language. If the test
% is successful the character can use that language. \\
% Failure means the character is not able to communicate in that language
% and will be limited to mime and gestures. The game master should assign
% a target number using his good sense, taking into account the character's
% background. A TN of 12 is suggested for common and easy languages;
% while rare or hard tongues should get higher numbers. Note that this
% test cannot be repeated without spending chits.\\
% A character who is \emph{bad at }or\emph{ OK at} Languages can only
% speak English.\\
% You can only try again with this skill after spending at least one
% week immersed in the language or after one month of intensive training.
% \item [{Sweet~Talk\,(CHA):}] This skill is used to convince people to
% agree with your opinions and make them do what you want them to do.
% It can even be used, God forbid, to tell some untruthful story to
% a policeman who may have just found you with a gold watch that just
% \emph{accidentally} fell into your pocket. The target number varies
% wildly; the story about a watch that \emph{accidentally} fell into
% a newsboy's pocket should command a TN of 15, at the very least.\\
% A fumble means the other person is angry enough that he would not
% pay attention to your words for one full week, and it could have the
% reverse consequences that you intended.\\
% You can try again as long as you don't fumble, but don't forget that
% each attempt raises the TN by 1.
