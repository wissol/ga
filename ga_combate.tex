\capitulo{Peleas y Persecuciones}

Grandes Aventuras no es un juego de combates. Sin embargo en las
aventuras a veces se encuentran con gentes dispuestas a practicar
la violencia si es conveniente a sus fines. Además, las consecuencias
pueden ser definitivas para los personajes y la aventura, por lo que
tenemos que dedicarle cierta atención.



% \section{Sequence }

% To have some control in the chaos of combat, \emph{Newsies \& Bootblacks
% }has a sequence of actions. Use it as a to-­do list for combat. You
% first have to do something, then you do something else. I know that
% it's a bit artificial to say you first shoot, move and then fight,
% or that fire ``fights'' when it burns, but many games use a similar
% structure and it works out quite nicely. So, let me introduce you
% to the full sequence below: 
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Surprise%
% \footnote{This step of the sequence occurs only when there is a chance of surprise.%
% }
% \item Initiative roll
% \item Shooting / Throwing / Ranged attacks 
% \item Movement / Reaction phase 
% \item Close combat 
% \item Checking for victory 
% \end{enumerate}

% \section{Surprise }

% This phase of the sequence is optional. In most circumstances both
% warring parties would be aware of each other, and in that case there
% is no need to roll for surprise; go directly to Section 6.3 ``Initiative''.
% Yet, when one group is ambushing another we need to see if they have
% achieved their goals.


% \subsection{The surprise roll}
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item The ambushers roll for Stealth, using the character with the \emph{worst}
% odds. The game master may grant special modifiers if the terrain,
% the weather or darkness are in favor of the ambushing party. The table
% below includes a few examples.
% \item Nobody can help in that roll.
% \item The ambushed group rolls for Observation, using the character with
% the \emph{best} odds. Again, nobody can help in that roll.
% \item If the ambushed party rolls a lower number than the ambushing party,
% they have been surprised.
% \item If the ambushed party rolls an equal or higher number than the ambushing
% party, they have not been surprised; continue with the normal sequence.
% \end{enumerate}
% \noindent \begin{center}
% \begin{tabular}{cc}
% \toprule 
% Situation & Modifier\tabularnewline
% \midrule
% \midrule 
% Night & +2\tabularnewline
% \midrule 
% Rain or worse & +1\tabularnewline
% \midrule 
% Total darkness & +3\tabularnewline
% \midrule 
% Main street & -3\tabularnewline
% \midrule 
% Heavy fog & +2\tabularnewline
% \midrule 
% Sewers & +3\tabularnewline
% \midrule 
% Sneaky alley & +1\tabularnewline
% \bottomrule
% \end{tabular}
% \par\end{center}


% \subsection{Effects of surprise}
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item The successful ambushers choose how close they get to the ambushed
% party.
% \item The surprised characters cannot move, shoot or attack for the rest
% of the turn.
% \item The successful ambushers can act normally.
% \item Proceed to Section 6.4 ``Shooting and Ranged Attacks'', as there
% is no need to roll for initiative.
% \end{enumerate}

% \section{Initiative }
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Every character rolls for Athletics.%
% \footnote{If using a bicycle or vehicle use the appropriate skill to ride them.%
% }
% \item Characters act in sequence according to their totals.
% \item In the event of a tie:

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Player characters act first, if still tied.
% \item Younger characters act first, if still tied.
% \item The character with the most chits acts first, if still tied.
% \item Roll again until you break the tie.
% \end{itemize}
% \end{enumerate}

% \section{Shooting, throwing and ranged attacks }
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Attacks by shooting are resolved just like any other skill check,
% using the appropriate skill. 
% \item In \emph{Newsies \& Bootblacks} all weapons are considered to be in
% range%
% \footnote{You can always try to hit, no matter how far away the target is.%
% }. 
% \end{enumerate}

% \subsection{Target number}
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item For most weapons, the TN is 6 + 1 for every full 10 yards of distance. 
% \item For short-range weapons, the TN is 6 + 1 for every five full yards
% of distance. 
% \item For extreme short-range weapons the TN is 4 + 1 for every two full
% yards of distance. 
% \item Add 1 if the target is crouching or taking cover under a table, behind
% a low wall or something like that. 
% \item Add 2 if the target is smaller than a head. (Or, if you can only see
% the head of your target.)
% \item Add 4 if you cannot see your target but it's still possible to hit
% the target; lobbing a stone, for example.
% \item The TN cannot get any higher than 18, nor any lower than 6.\end{enumerate}
% \begin{quote}
% Example: Pip wants to hit a can that is 30 yards away, using his slingshot.
% The slingshot is a short-range weapon, so the TN for this roll is
% 6 + (30/5) + 2 = 6 + 6 + 2 = 14. Had he tried to do the same with
% a huge rock, an extreme short-range weapon, the TN would have been
% 4 + (30/2) + 2 = 4 + 15 + 2 = 21; which is cut down to 18 (the maximum
% TN as per point 7 above). Wish him luck.
% \end{quote}

% \subsection{Dodging ranged attacks}
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item All missile and thrown attacks can be dodged%
% \footnote{Yes, this includes bullets and ninja stars.%
% }, \emph{provided the character is aware of the attack and can see
% his attacker. }
% \item The target number to dodge an attack is the number the attacker rolled.
% \item Double the target number if dodging a bullet.
% \item Each attack can be attempted to dodge just once.
% \item There is no limit to the number of different attacks a \emph{player
% character} can attempt to dodge.
% \item A non-player character can only attempt to dodge as many attacks as
% the number of dice of his Agility attribute. (So a policeman with
% an AGI score of 4 wd, can attempt to dodge up to 4 attacks per turn.)
% \end{enumerate}

% \section{Movement and reaction phase}

% Every character, animal or vehicle in this game moves one pace per
% turn at their normal speed. The trick lies in that some paces are
% longer than others. For anybody younger than nine; one pace equals
% two yards per turn; for nine to 11, that's three yards per turn; for
% 12 to 14 it's four yards per turn, while those 15 years of age and
% older move at five yards per turn. The following table demonstrates
% some examples. The game master may adapt those for anything not covered
% here, such as giant apes or aliens from outer space. 

% That explains your basic walking movement, but there could be times
% when you want to go much faster. In those cases you have to roll on
% Athletics, Riding or Vehicles. Your choice depends on whether you
% are on your feet, riding a horse or using some modern vehicle. The
% target number should be determined by the game master, taking into
% account the state of the ground, the weather and any other appropriate
% circumstances. If everything is normal the TN should be 10. 

% After passing the test, the character doubles his pace%
% \footnote{Or that of the vehicle he's using.%
% }. Triple the pace if the character achieves a spectacular success.

% However, if you fumble you only move half your pace and then suffer
% a mishap. If you are running or riding a bicycle when you suffer the
% mishap, you trip or fall to the ground, possibly getting a few bruises.
% Inside a vehicle, both driver and passengers could suffer life-threatening
% wounds%
% \footnote{Details can be found in Section \vref{sec:Damage}.%
% }.

% \par\end{center}


% \section{Close combat}
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Every character can only attack once per turn%
% \footnote{Except in very special cases, as determined by the game master.%
% }.
% \item A character who is facing an enemy at less than \emph{two yards} or
% so, can attack in close combat.
% \item The attacker rolls for the appropriate \emph{weapon,} skill, or Fisticuffs,
% if fighting unarmed.
% \item The attacker should add or subtract the appropriate modifiers that
% the game master imposes on the roll, to provide for special circumstances.
% A table with examples follows.
% \item The defender rolls, using his Dodging skill.
% \item If the defender rolls higher or equal to the attacker, the attack
% has failed.
% \item If the attacker rolls higher than the defender, the attack has been
% successful and the defender will probably suffer some form of harm.

% \section{Damage \label{sec:Damage}}

% When your character gets hit, he will more than likely suffer some
% damage and in some cases death (unless you use one of your handy chits).
% Combat in this game ­as in real life, ­canbe quite deadly. Fortunately,
% most often you will not be using real weapons. Honest traders do not
% sell real weapons of any kind to children, and weapon possession ­while
% lawful, ­is not common in New Paris City. Rarely, in most campaigns,
% will you ever see a gun used in anger. If you do you'd better run
% because those things kill fast. 


% \subsection{The damage roll}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Test your Health against the damage rank of the weapon that hit you.
% \item The damage rank of unarmed attacks is equal to a roll of the attacker's
% Strength dice (STR)%
% \footnote{Pip's Strength is three weak dice, so when he hits an opponent he'll
% roll three weak dice; the total being the damage rank of the attack.%
% }.
% \item The damage rank of most hand-to-hand weapons is equal to a roll of
% the attacker's Strength dice plus some modifier.
% \item The damage rank of most missile weapons is a fixed number.
% \item The effects depend on the nature of the weapon and your roll.\end{itemize}
% \begin{description}
% \item [{Non-Lethal~Weapons:}] These are those weapons which cannot normally
% kill an adult in a novel or story. In real life, it's perfectly possible
% to kill somebody with a cane or by stoning them, but it is stories,
% films and comics that we are trying to simulate; not real life. 

% \begin{description}
% \item [{Success:}] If your character has passed the Health check he is
% uninjured. He was tough enough and there's nothing to worry about. 
% \item [{Fail:}] If your character has failed the Health check you will
% receive a bruise. Each bruise gives you a malus of ­ 1 for all your
% actions. 

% \begin{quote}
% \emph{For example:} you are involved in a fight with a band of bullies.
% They hit you seven times in the face (ouch!). That means you have
% to test your Health seven times. You are lucky (or tough) enough to
% pass five of these checks. But you failed two of these so you received
% two bruises. Now you are at \emph{-}2, so every time you roll the
% dice to check for a skill or attribute, you subtract 2 points to every
% roll. If you later receive another bruise, you'll be at \emph{-}3
% and you'll have to subtract 3 points to every roll, and so on. 
% \end{quote}
% \item [{Fumble:}] If you fumble the check you move down one step in the
% damage scale. This is explained in Section 6.7.2. It means you go
% from swell to hurt, from hurt to grave and from grave to dead. 
% \end{description}
% \item [{Toy~Weapons:}] Toys that cannot kill an adult%
% \footnote{In real life silly accidents are always possible.%
% }. In fact, most may only cause embarrassment. We are speaking of such
% terrible instruments as cakes, splashing of water and such. 

% \begin{description}
% \item [{Success:}] If your character has passed the Health check he is
% uninjured. He was tough enough and there's nothing to worry about. 
% \item [{Fail:}] If your character has failed the Health check you will
% receive a bruise. Each bruise gives you a malus of -1 for all your
% actions. However, unlike the case of non-lethal weapons, all the \emph{damage}
% that toy weapons cause is \emph{healed} right after the end of the
% fight. Remember to record toy weapons damage separately.
% \item [{Fumble:}] Your character is so embarrassed that he will not be
% able to act for one turn, and may be either crying as a baby or shouting
% ferocious, angry threats.
% \item [{Toy~Weapons~vs~Lethal~Weapons:}] If any lethal or extremely
% lethal weapon is used in the action, toy weapons cease to cause any
% harm at all. When you see a shotgun nobody cares about being hit by
% a cake. 
% \end{description}
% \item [{Lethal~Weapons:}] Weapons that can kill somebody in a story, though
% most times the afflicted character survives. We are speaking of knives,
% the teeth of a strong dog and very small pistols such as a derringer. 

% \begin{description}
% \item [{Spectacular~Success:}] Luckily, the attack was too weak and your
% character is unharmed.
% \item [{Success:}] If your character passes the Health check he is still
% bruised and you receive a -\,1 bruise. 
% \item [{Fail:}] If your character fails the Health check he moves down
% one step in the damage scale that moves in succession from swell to
% hurt to grave and finally, to dead%
% \footnote{More details are found in section \ref{sub:TDamage-Scale.}. %
% }. 
% \item [{Fumble:}] If your character fumbles he will die unless you spend
% a chit right away. 
% \end{description}
% \item [{Extremely~Lethal~Weapons:}] Weapons that can kill an adult in
% one single attack, and often do so in stories. Examples include swords,
% revolvers, rifles or large fires. You are advised to be very careful
% when somebody uses them. 

% \begin{description}
% \item [{Spectacular~Success:}] Even with a spectacular success your character
% receives one bruise. Consider it a scratch.
% \item [{Success:}] If your character passes the Health check he moves up
% one step in the damage scale.
% \item [{Fail~or~Fumble:}] If your character fails or fumbles he will
% die unless you spend a chit right away.

% \par\end{center}


% \subsubsection{Special weapons}

% Some weapons are so special they cannot be easily included in a table.
% Let me introduce you to the following:
% \begin{description}
% \item [{Cane-Sword:}] A sword in a cane. With just a turn of your wrist
% on the head of the cane, you will have a sword on your hands.
% \item [{Pepperbox~Pistol:}] The grandfather of the revolver. The pepperbox
% pistol has several individually loaded barrels that rotate as the
% trigger is pulled. Treat it as a revolver.
% \item [{``My~Friend'':}] A knuckle-duster pepperbox combo. This odd
% weapon is shaped so it can easily be held and used as a knuckle-duster.
% \item [{Gaulois~Pistol:}] The Gaulois pistol looks like an elaborate cigar
% case of A-grade, yet it's intended for self-defense at close range.
% Use it as a revolver, but lower the range to extreme short.
% \item [{Penknife~Pistol:}] A penknife and pistol combination. Treat it
% as a derringer when shooting. If used in hand-to-hand combat, treat
% it as a cane.
% \item [{Walking-Stick~Gun:}] A carbine disguised as a stick. Use it as
% a rifle, but lower the damage to 13.
% \end{description}

% \subsection{The damage scale\label{sub:TDamage-Scale.}}

% The damage scale is an easy way to say how hurt a character is. Every
% player starts at swell and during game time, they may be downgraded
% to hurt. From hurt a player worsens to grave, which is a serious condition,
% and then finally, dead. Each of these conditions have an effect on
% what a character can do. An explanation of these follows. 
% \begin{description}
% \item [{Swell:}] Your character is perfectly healthy and you have nothing
% to worry about. Bruises are kept from the damage scale, so no matter
% how many bruises you get, you retain your swell status. You can be
% swell and still be at -\,­5 bruises or worse. 
% \item [{Hurt:}] Your character is suffering from a wound or sickness that
% is serious enough to hinder your actions, but not to endanger your
% life. You are at -\,­5 for all your actions (in addition to any bruises).
% So, if you have -\,3 bruises, you are down to -\,­8. 
% \item [{Grave:}] Your character is in real trouble. You are wounded and
% at -\,­5 for all your actions plus any bruises, just as when you
% are hurt. However, it hurts so much you need to roll for Health with
% a TN of 10, just for standing up. Walking requires a TN of 12. Running
% and other strenuous physical activities are next to impossible. 
% \item [{Dead:}] If you don't spend a chit immediately your character is
% quite dead. There is nothing your friends can do about it, except
% to arrange for a decent burial. The game master might let you say
% up to 25 last words. 
% \end{description}

% \subsection{Effects of damage on non-living objects}

% For non-living objects, the game master should assign a fake Health
% attribute. Bruised items will only need a paint job, suffering no
% harm. Hurt items lose one level of quality. Grave items lose two levels
% of quality. Dead items are considered destroyed for all functional
% purposes.

% If an item drops lower than E-grade, it is also destroyed.


% \section{Checking for victory}

% Once all the characters have had the opportunity to act, the turn
% is over. Then the game master should check for victory if any of the
% following conditions have been met.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item The non-player group (and only the non-player group) has been surprised
% in this turn.
% \item It's not a serious fight%
% \footnote{Like in a cake throwing battle.%
% } and the non-player group has suffered more bruises than the player
% character group in this turn.
% \item The non-player group has suffered more hurt (or worse) results than
% the player character group in this turn.
% \item The game master considers that the non-player group has little chance
% to win.
% \end{itemize}
% To check for victory, the game master rolls three normal dice. The
% usual TN is 11, but the game master can increase or decrease this
% number according to the circumstances of the fight.
% \begin{description}
% \item [{Success:}] The non-player group keeps fighting another turn.
% \item [{Fail:}] The non-player group will try to break off combat right
% away, saving their belongings and helping the injured members of their
% group, if any. If the players decide to run after them, uninjured
% non-player characters will defend themselves if attacked; hurt or
% worse non-player characters will surrender as soon as they are in
% close combat range.
% \item [{Fumble:}] The non-player group will run away immediately, as fast
% as they are able, dropping whatever they are carrying and forsaking
% any injured members of their group. If the players decide to run after
% them, the non-player characters will surrender as soon as they are
% in close combat range.
% \end{description}

% \section{\label{sec:Healing}Healing}
% \begin{description}
% \item [{Bruises:}] Healed after a good full night of rest.
% \item [{Bruises~from~Toy~Weapons:}] These are healed immediately after
% the fight is ended. (Write a small ``t'' on your character sheet
% to tell these from regular bruises.)
% \item [{Hurt~or~Grave:}] A hurt or grave character needs some form of
% medical attention. The healer (doctor, nurse or amateur) should roll
% for Healing with a TN of 11 if the character is hurt or 14 if he is
% grave. This roll encompasses all the Healing attempts in any given
% day and can only be tried once a day.

% \begin{description}
% \item [{Fumble:}] The character's condition worsens. Hurt worsens to grave
% and grave worsens to dead (unless the character spends 1 chit).
% \item [{Fail:}] Roll one die. On a roll of 1 the character's condition
% worsens, as if the healer had fumbled. On a roll of 2 to 4 the character
% remains hurt or grave. On a roll of 5 to 6, the character's condition
% improves. Grave worsens to hurt and hurt recovers to swell, but with
% five bruises that will heal normally after a good full night of rest.
% \item [{Success:}] The character's condition improves. Grave improves to
% hurt and hurt recovers to swell, but with five bruises that will heal
% normally after a good full night of rest.
% \item [{Exceptional~Success:}] The character's condition improves. Grave
% recovers to swell, but with five bruises that will heal normally after
% a good full night of rest; hurt recovers immediately.
% \end{description}
% \end{description}
% If the character receives no medical attention, roll one die. On a
% roll of 1 or 2 the character's condition worsens. On a roll of 3 to
% 5 the character remains hurt or grave. On a roll of 6, the character's
% condition improves. Grave improves to hurt and hurt recovers to swell,
% but with five bruises that will heal normally after a good full night
% of rest.
