\section*{Thank you for buying this game}

\noindent \lettrine{Y}{}ou are helping me realize the dream of designing
and publishing my first game. The 12-year-old in me could not be happier.
You have in front of you, the result of my efforts. I have tried to
create a jolly, original game that will provide you with hours of
fun. I also want to thank you on the behalf of \href{http://www.lovesbridge.org}{Love's Bridge},
an organization that helps children and young people who are having
it rough in Perm, Russia. Every cent I am making from this game will
be donated to them. If you think I have done good work, please tip
them.

Scores of bootblack angels will sing you into your dream


\section*{\emph{Newsies \& Bootblacks}: A role-playing game}

Have you ever played a role-playing game? I mean the kind you play
around a table, together with your friends. If you have, you know
the drill so well that I am glad you are reading this chapter. Why?
Because \emph{Newsies \& Bootblacks} employs ordinary six-sided dice,
yet uses them in a unique way. 

It would be a good idea to begin with Newsies \& Bootblacks: First
Game. It is a quick introduction into the game that includes a ready-to-play
adventure. This you can download for free on the \href{http://minimrpg.com}{MiniM Role-playing}
website and \emph{probably} from where you bought this game too. This
is not a very hard game with hundreds of rules to remember. However,
it is always more fun to start by plunging right into a game, and
you will be playing a lot faster with the first game.

If you have never played a role-playing game before, we need to do
some talking. You assemble a few friends around a table; each gets
to play the role of an adventurous hero. As we role-players love big
flashy words, we call these\emph{ }player characters. These characters
are supposed to be living in some imaginary world, either the one
presented in this book, or some other, such as Narnia, Middle Earth,
or one of your own fantasy. 

The setting may be historical, such as life during the time of the
Three Musketeers, or the pioneers of the American Old West. The time
period may be the present, the past, the future or even something
completely out of time. You can play events as they actually took
place, but altering history may also be the foundation for a great
game. What if Rome did not fall to the barbarians? What if the Anglo-Saxon
shield wall held and William, the Conqueror of England was defeated?
What if the Cherokee had managed to establish a recognized state in
America?%
\footnote{If you are not sure what a role-playing game is, you should ask a
friend or consult \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game_\%28pen_and_paper\%29}{Wikipedia},
which hosts a very good \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game_\%28pen_and_paper\%29}{article}
on role-playing.%
}

Role-playing games are not only about brave new worlds or superpowers.
Those are just the bells and whistles. Role-playing games are all
about stories, simulation, fun and above all, heroes; people who choose
to be the best that they can be. 


\subsection*{So, who is a hero?}
\begin{verse}
Some time ago, when I was teaching, I met this boy in a boarding school.
He was quite the hard-working kid who was always striving for the
best; the kind of pupil teachers like. One day, in the dorms, one
of his friends asked him, ``J, why do you study so hard?'' His answer
was, ``Because it feels so great when I go to bed.'' The other kids
sighed with relief and one of them said, ``You are lazy, just like
us.'' Our hero answered nothing, nodded his head and then looked
at me with a face that said ``They don't get it.'' I understood;
it feels great to go to bed when you have done your best. If you live
your own life to its fullest you are a hero, and that's what \emph{Newsies
\& Bootblacks} is all about.
\end{verse}
These heroes need adventures. Getting up at 4 a.m. on Sunday mornings
might seem tough enough. Suppose you are 12 years old. Pickpockets,
mobsters and worse, hide in the still dark alleys that lead to Newspaper's
Row. There you go, under the chilly falling snow, your pockets filled
with your last hard-earned pennies to buy a bundle of papers that
you will sell, one by one, for a small profit.

A piece of cake? Then add a friendly little ghost and her not-so-friendly
huge ghost mother. A felonious foreign spy with an unhealthy interest
in you -- are you sure you know your \emph{real }parents? -- might
be in the game. A mad scientist might think you will make a great
test subject for his death ray. Or what about surviving a mob of gangsters
that is five feet wide?

In a novel or film, heroes rarely fail. They may get kicked in the
first scene or throughout the story, but in the end, more often than
not, they beat the bad guys. That is not guaranteed in \emph{Newsies
\& Bootblacks}. If you think hard and play smart you can win, but
any mistake could have dire consequences for your character. 

That's why we have a game master. She or he is a referee and narrator
combined. The game master should know the rules thoroughly, keep all
the secrets of the story and decide the outcome of the actions attempted
by any character. The game master is also in charge of running the
game world: the weather, the events and all its inhabitants, including
the non-player characters. 

I know from first-hand experience that being a game master can be
quite rewarding if you do it well. While not easy, it is not incredibly
hard either. Let's suppose Elizabeth is the game master in a high
fantasy game with knights, dragons and all that old-fashioned%
\footnote{Still always great fun!%
} stuff.

She could begin the game describing a basic situation: \emph{``You
are walking through a thick forest when suddenly, a strange whistling
sound and a startling breeze surprise you. As you turn and look up
through the branches and leaves, you spot a red dragon, flying. What
do you do?''}

The player characters are then free to attempt any action they like.
Do they want to hide? That idea is fine, and probably smart, too.
Fight? Then pray, but you can try. Invite the beast to dinner? Feel
free to; just don't blame me if you become the main course. The choices
you make often have consequences you never imagined, and can lead
into small adventures of their own.

The game master, aided by the rules and usually some rolls of dice,
will determine the outcome of your intended action. The game can progress
to the end of the story, which can be quite surprising.


\subsection*{Who wins? }

In role-playing games there is no easy answer to this question. Unlike
most conventional games, there is no score keeping of \emph{us} versus
\emph{them}. In that sense, there are no winners or losers. If you
have lived a good story and it has been fun, then consider yourself
a winner.

That said, every adventure you play in \emph{Newsies \& Bootblacks}
will have some kind of objective; something your characters want or
need. Sometimes the objective will be obvious, like discovering a
treasure or rescuing a friend. Sometimes the game master will keep
the main objective hidden for most of the adventure, or it could change
in the middle of the game, but there should always be an objective.

So watch out. If your group achieves the objective your character
will be rewarded in some way. Not to mention, you will feel much more
accomplished. But remember, it is a group effort, not an individual
one. You cannot really win if your friends lose; not in a role-playing
game and certainly not in real life, either.


\subsection*{An example game session}

I could keep writing on and on, but the best way to understand a game
is to see one being played. If you can, find some people who play
and join their group, or attend a game convention in your area. In
the meantime, see what you can get from this dialog, which is, according
to my experience, what could happen in a role-playing game session.
\begin{verse}
Martin (game master): \emph{``OK, so are you going to follow that
pickpocket down to the sewers or not? You have five seconds.''}

Tammy: \emph{``I say we go. I want my stuff back.''} Tammy plays
a 12-year-old daredevil kind of newsgirl.

Daniel:\emph{ ``I don't know. There could be crocs down there, you
know.''} Daniel's character is just nine, and not exactly brawny.

James: \emph{``Crocs, yeah, come on, let's go.''} James' character
at 13, has all the potential, but no motivation to be a bully. 

Daniel: \emph{``And what about the ghost we saw yesterday?''}

Tammy: \emph{``You don't know if it was really a ghost, do you? And
whatever it was, we beat it.''}

Martin: \emph{``Are you going or not? The pickpocket is running away
as you speak.''}

Tammy and James: \emph{``We go!''}

Daniel: \emph{``OK, but don't blame me if you end up in the gator's
belly.''}

Martin: \emph{``OK, as you go down to the tunnels you realize how
dark they are, not to mention damp and smelly. Are you sure you want
to go on?''}

Daniel: \emph{``No.''}

Tammy: \emph{``What?! Of course we want to.''}

James: \emph{``I'm with Tammy.''}

Martin: \emph{``OK, I want all of you to make an Eyes \& Ears check.
Roll your dice. The target number is 13.''}

Daniel: \emph{``I've got a 14; am I OK?''}

Martin: \emph{``Yes.''}

Tammy: \emph{``Oh, oh, I've got a 12.''}

James: \emph{``And it's an 8 for me. My luck, always my luck!''}

Martin:\emph{ ``OK. So Daniel you stop right in time, but Tammy and
James walk confidently into a stream of brownish water. It rises up
to your elbows. I'm sure you know what kind of water this is, don't
you?''}

Daniel bursts into laughter.

Martin: \emph{``Now, Daniel, you might have heard something to your
back. Make another Eyes \& Ears check, please. The target number is
11 this time.''}
\end{verse}
This is only a small excerpt of a game session, but I feel it is good
enough to get a feeling of what role-playing is all about. Don't you
worry, I began just with one book and some dice, back in the times
when there was no Internet and none of my friends knew anything about
role-playing games. You will figure it out just fine, and remember,
it is OK if you don't play perfectly the first time. Nobody does.


\section*{Dice}

\emph{Newsies \& Bootblacks} uses normal six-sided dice. They are
made stronger or weaker than regular dice, just by the way you read
them. 
\begin{description}
\item [{\nomenclature{Fool Dice}{For example when you roll a "Fool Dice" you ignore any result higher than 4. That means that if you get a 5 or 6 you read it as if it were a 4.}Fool~Dice\,(fd)\,:}] When
you roll fool dice ignore any result higher than 4. That means if
you roll a 5 or 6 you read it as if it were a 4.
\item [{\nomenclature{Weak Dice}{When you roll a "Weak Dice", you ignore any result higher than 5. That means that if you get a 6, you read it as if it were a 5.}Weak~Dice\,(wd)\,:}] When
you roll weak dice ignore any result higher than 5. That means if
you roll a 6, you read it as if it were a 5.
\item [{\nomenclature{Normal}{These you read normally. A 1 is a 1, a 2 is a 2, a 6 is a 6 and so on.}Normal~Dice\,(nd)\,:}] These
you read normally; a 1 is a 1, a 2 is a 2, a 6 is a 6, and so on.
(Also known as OK dice.)
\item [{\nomenclature{Swell}{When you roll a "Swell Dice", you ignore any result lower than 3. That means that if you get a 1 or a 2 you read the dice as if it were a 6.}Swell~Dice\,(sd)\,:}] When
you roll any swell dice, ignore any result lower than 3. That means
when you roll a 1 or a 2 you read the die as if it were a 3.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Tips with dice}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use different colors or sizes for each kind of dice to avoid confusion.
\item Failing that, roll dice in order: fool dice first, then weak, then
normal and then swell.
\item You could play with just one die; however, I prefer to use two sets
of three dice with each set in a particular size or color.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Miscellanea}


\subsection{Quality grades}

In \emph{Newsies \& Bootblacks}, anything can be graded in the traditional
school grades of A, B, C, D and\emph{ }E. C is pretty ordinary, cheap
stuff, A is great and E is barely usable trash.

A prince would only wear A-grade clothes, unless he swaps them for
the E-grade clothes of a beggar as in the Mark Twain tale. An E-grade
ship is always leaking and likely to sink at the first storm. A C-grade
newspaper is what most people read. Newsies are (there is no shame
in the truth) rather poor. They are used to wearing and using mostly
D-grade stuff: hand-me-downs, used clothing bought in a shop or traded
between themselves.


\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{description}
\item [{\nomenclature{Attribute:}{Major stats which define the capabilites of a character. In Newsies |& Bootblacks these are: Strength, Agility, Health, Education, Eyes & Ears, Education and Charisma.}Attribute:}] Major
stats that define the capabilities of a character. In \emph{Newsies
\& Bootblacks} these are: Strength\emph{, }Agility\emph{, }Health\emph{,
}Education\emph{, }Eyes \& Ears and\emph{ }Charisma\emph{.}
\item [{\nomenclature{Game Master (GM):}{The person who is in charge of interpreting the rules, narrating the scence and insuring that everyone has a great time.}Game~Master\,(GM):}] The
person who is in charge of interpreting the rules, narrating the scene
and insuring that everyone has a great time.
\item [{New~Paris:}] New Paris is the city (and the state) designed to
be the main location for the game%
\footnote{You can have your games set just about anywhere.%
}. It's just south of New York and just as lively, with a brilliant
cultural life, a few decrepit, crime-ridden areas and lots of mysteries.
\item [{\emph{Newsies~\&~Bootblacks}:}] This game.
\item [{\nomenclature{Non-player Characters (NPC):}{Any character, animal or monster, spirit or ghost who is not played by any player. These are usually neutral but can be either friends or foes. They are all played and controlled by the game master.}Non-Player~Character\,(NPC):}] Any
character, animal or monster, spirit or ghost who is not played by
any player. These are usually neutral but can be either friends or
foes. They are all played and controlled by the game master.
\item [{\nomenclature{Player Character (PC):}{Any character played by a player, usually just one character per player.}Player~Character\,(PC):}] Any
character played by a player; usually just one character per player.
\item [{\nomenclature{Real or Game Time}{Real time refers to the time spent in the real world while game time refers to the time spent in the game world.}Real~Time~or~Game~Time:}] When
I mention real time, I refer to time spent in the real world. Game
time\emph{ }refers to the time spent in the game world. The distinction
is important to avoid confusion between the real world and the game
world; people ringing your door at dawn if you told them something
like, \textquotedblleft{}Hey, we are meeting tomorrow at 5 a.m.!\textquotedblright{}
\item [{Skill:\nomenclature{Skill}{An area or field of expertise. Each skill is linked to one attribute.}}] An
area or field of expertise. Each skill is linked to one attribute.
Notice that every attribute but Health has skills linked to them.
\end{description}

\subsection{The game and real life}


\subsubsection*{Real life can get real tough}

Even today, there are many homeless children living on their own.
Perhaps they are closer to home than you think, selling papers or
finding other ways to survive. This game does not try to simulate
real life but instead, the imagined life of novels and films, and
even those interpreted from a modern perspective. In these worlds
it is easier to survive and there always seems to be a caring person
around. Yes, it is true that death persecutes Oliver Twist and that
Gravroche from Les Miserables dies, but the former always finds a
twist in the story that saves him and the latter dies heroically.


\subsubsection*{Boys and girls}

It is less known but true, that many girls work on the streets of
New Paris as peddlers, newsies, bootblacks and in other street business.
They are less visible for two main reasons: society prejudice and
protection. It is not that people would buy less papers from girls
than boys, but the collective ideal that girls should stay at home
helping their mothers is still strong, even when they have no mother
to help. Second, many girls feel they are safer in the streets by
pretending to be tough or in other words, by pretending to be boys.
Being young enough, all that is required is a haircut and a change
of clothes.

Players can play a character of any gender they prefer. It is OK if
you want to play either a boy or a girl. Remember it's just a game,
but don't make anybody play a character they don't like. That is just
boring.


\subsubsection*{Girls and the Newsboy Lodge }

I will be telling you more about the Newsboy Lodge \vref{cha:The-Newsboy-Lodge}
but for now, let's say it's a very cheap hotel for newsboys. Now,
what about the girls? My take is that they have separate dorms in
the Newsboy Lodge, but perhaps the game master or player characters
would prefer separate institutions and as such, there would be a Newsgirl
Lodge. Or, you could say there is no Newsboy Lodge for girls, or for
anybody, or that it's just filled up. Please note that if you decide
there's no Newsboy Lodge or similar institution in your adventure,
then it would be easy for the player characters to be quite homeless.


\subsubsection{Racism and other stupid discriminations }

One of the good things about a game of fantasy, even low fantasy such
as this one, is that you don't have to repeat the silliness of real
life. And so, racism is virtually unknown in the general population.
In New Paris, unless said otherwise, suppose that in any area, half
the population is white. There's no perfect place and surely New Paris
City can improve in this regard, but for most situations you can assume
people would not mind the color of your skin. 

However, New Parisians surely discriminate against the poor, especially
on Royal Island. If you look poor it's because you deserve being poor
and you should know your place. It's as un-American as un-American
can be, but that's the way of Royal Island.


\subsubsection*{Issues to avoid }

There are a few issues I have purposefully avoided in this game; sexual
abuse, self-harm, severe emotional distress or the use of drugs. I
earnestly recommend you avoid them as well. Trust me; as a former
volunteer working with street children, I have witnessed some of these.
They're nothing I'd be gaming about, period. It hurts even as I type.


\part{Rules}


\chapter{Player characters\label{cha:Characters}}

\noindent \lettrine{G}{}ood characters make great stories. If you
know who the characters are and what they want, just add a complication
and a setting and you have an adventure. In \emph{Newsies \& Bootblacks},
player characters are not the usual lot of extraordinary guys with
uncanny powers, but rather, they are mere boys and girls from age
nine to 14 when they first enter the game, and never older than 16.
Once a character hits his 17th birthday, he is retired for the game.
Player characters are poor and orphaned, living on their own on the
streets of New Paris. What they do have is extra luck, but even this
benefit will run out fast in the face of adventure if not used wisely. 

This game uses numbers to describe your player character. These numbers
tell you how many dice you need to roll when your character tries
to run away from a ghost, or what happens if it falls down the stairs;
how strong he is, or the skills he commands, etc.

In this chapter you will learn how to create your player character.
Skim through it first so you have a better idea of what decisions
to make. You will need a few dice, some pencils and paper (an index
card will do), so you can write down all the information.

There is also a character sheet on the last page of this book which
you can print to record all your character information. 


\section{Who are you?}


\subsection*{Age}

We need to know how old your character is. Roll one die. Write the
number down and add 8 to determine your character's age. If you rolled
a 4, your character will be 12; 4 + 8 = 12. If you are smart you'll
soon realize that your character can be of any age from nine to 14. 

If you%
\footnote{Not your character, but you the player. %
} are younger than 16, you don't need to roll. Just choose how old
your character is. Remember that your character cannot be a day younger
than nine or older than 14.

Is it better for a character to be young or old in this game? That's
a tough question to answer. If you are older, you'll generally be
stronger and have more knowledge. But if you are younger you'll be
luckier. In fact, you'll have more chits\emph{,} but we'll speak about
those later.


\subsubsection*{In short}
\begin{itemize}
\item Roll one die and add 8. The result is your character's age.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Name and gender}

Next, we need to know your character's name. Choose any name you want
and write it down. Choose your character's gender too. In this game
it doesn't matter if your character is a boy or a girl, except when
he or she goes to the restroom. It's OK if you are a boy and you want
to play a girl%
\footnote{\noindent Many homeless girls who live on their own pretend to be
boys, just to look tough.%
} or the other way around. Your character's gender doesn't have to
match your gender.


\subsection*{In short}
\begin{itemize}
\item Choose any name you want for your character.
\item Choose any gender you want for your character.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Birthday}

Finally, we need to know your character's birthday. You can choose
any day of the year. This is important, because in \emph{Newsies \&
Bootblacks} your character suddenly improves on their birthday. The
game master does not need to tell you the date in which the game begins,
so don't ask.


\section{Attributes}

Attributes are the figures that define your character's basic capabilities.
It is important that you understand what each one of these is used
for. 


\subsection{These are your attributes}
\begin{description}
\item [{Strength\,(STR):}] Measures how strong you are. A character can
use Strength to lift a heavy weight, break things, throw a stone to
see how far it goes or fight off a bully. Adults tend to be much stronger
than any newsboy. As far as this game is concerned, girls can be just
as strong as any boy.
\item [{Health\,(HTH):}] A measure of your character's resistance to sickness,
fatigue, poisons, bullets and thrown cream cakes. Your character could
be exposed to all of these and worse.
\item [{Agility\,(AGI):}] Tells you how graciously your character moves.
A character with low Agility will never be a good athlete. Agility
is also important to handle a bike, ride, run or hide from a band
of gangsters.
\item [{Education\,(EDU):}] Measures how much the character knows about
the world. Anything that can be known and learned falls within the
range of Education. If you want your character to be a mechanic or
know how to dress a wound, you'll want his Education attribute to
be as high as possible%
\footnote{What about intelligence? I believe only the player can provide that.%
}.
\item [{Eyes~\&~Ears\,(E\&E):}] Measures how well your character can
understand what's going on around him. Please remember that it does
include \emph{all five senses}%
\footnote{So why Eyes \& Ears? Because sight and hearing will be by far, the
most used of the five senses and this name is easy to understand for
very young players.%
}; not just sight and hearing. If your character needs to find a secret
message hidden under a rubble stone, follow the scent of a chemical
to the secret laboratory of a mad scientist or listen to the whisper
of a foreign spy, you'd better be as strong as possible in this attribute.
\item [{Charisma\,(CHA):}] Measures how cute, swell, nice, handsome, cheerful,
good-looking and cool your character is, all rolled into one attribute.
Charisma is great when you want to sell papers to the public, learn
a new language, sign, beg, convince or juggle for money and fun.\end{description}

Note that all humans have a least one weak die assigned to each of
these attributes, as will most animals. A few monsters, such as ghosts,
will not use each and every one of these. Please, take time to consider
before adding any new attributes to your game. Do so only if you sorely
need it.
\end{quote}

\subsection{This is how you generate your attributes}

We pay for new dice with attribute points\emph{~}(APs). You begin
with as many attribute points as your age, plus seven. 


\subsubsection*{In short }
\begin{itemize}
\item AP = Age + 7
\end{itemize}
With those attribute points you can buy dice for your character's
attributes. Every weak die costs 1 AP, while a normal die costs two
APs.\emph{ }You can also upgrade a weak die to a normal die for 1
AP\emph{. Adult characters can have allocated up to six dice in any
single attribute. However, these are all non-player characters played
by the game master.}%
\footnote{As\emph{ }normal dice are not twice as powerful as weak dice, read
a 6 as if it were a 5. It is a good idea to buy weak dice until you
have four dice in any single attribute. Then, if you still need to
improve that attribute, upgrade those weak dice to normal dice.%
}. \emph{Every attribute must have at least one die allocated to it}.

In case you are wondering, you can't buy swell or fool\emph{ }dice.
Your character's skills upgrade your normal dice to\emph{ }swell dice
or in some cases, downgrade your weak dice to fool dice. These will
be explained in more detail in the following chapter.

Be wise when you split up these dice. If your character gets very
strong but is so ugly that dogs run away from him, they won't sell
many papers. And, they can be as cute as a kitty with angel wings,
but if they stay most days in bed sick, they won't be of much help,
either.


\subsubsection*{In short}
\begin{itemize}
\item One weak die\,(wd) = 1 AP
\item One normal die\,(nd) = 2 AP
\item Upgrade one wd to one nd = 1 AP
\item Maximum number of dice in any single attribute = 4
\item Minimum number of dice in any single attribute = 4
\item You can't buy swell or fool dice.
\end{itemize}

\section{Pace}

Pace is a measure of your character's speed, expressed as how many
yards your character can walk per turn%
\footnote{A turn is a vague measure of time roughly equivalent to ``just a
moment''%
}. Your character's pace depends on his age. For anybody younger than
nine, one pace equals two yards per turn; for nine to 11 it's three
yards per turn; for 12 to 14 it's four yards per turn, while characters
15 years and older move at five yards per turn.

Obviously, your character can move faster by running or sprinting,
but we will leave those details to Chapter 6 ``Fights and Chases''.
Right now, all you have to do is record your character's pace on the
character sheet.


\section{Skills}


\subsection{These are your skills}

Skills are stats just like attributes, only less broad. Agility (attribute),
tells us how well you move in general, while Riding (skill), for example,
tells us how good you are at handling a bike.


\subsubsection*{This game has 21 skills open to player characters:\medskip{}
}
\begin{quote}
\begin{onehalfspace}
\textsc{Fisticuffs (STR), Throwing (STR), Athletics (AGI), Climbing
(AGI), Dodging (AGI), Locks (AGI), Pickpockets (AGI), Riding (AGI),
Stealth (AGI), Swimming (AGI), Vehicles (AGI), Academics (EDU), Crafts
(EDU), Healing (EDU), Mechanics (EDU), Streetwise (EDU), Observation
(E\&E), Shooting (E\&E), Languages (CHA), Performance (CHA) and Sweet
Talk (CHA) }\end{onehalfspace}

\end{quote}
\medskip{}
You will figure out that Athletics is good for climbing, jumping and
playing football; Fisticuffs\emph{ }comes in handy for brawling and
Healing helps to fix people after that brawling. Other skills might
be a little harder to figure out. If you need help, they are better
explained in Chapter 3, Section 3.8. \eqref{cha:Testing-skills-and}

Every skill is linked to an attribute that is shown in brackets. For
example, Academics\,(EDU) is a skill linked to the Education attribute.
That means if you are \emph{good at} Academics (an Education skill),
you roll using your Education dice, but upgraded.

Notice that no skill is linked to the Health attribute.


\subsection{How you generate your skills}

First, find out how many skills your character is \emph{good at}.
These are as many as his age minus 6. If your character is nine, he's
\emph{good at} 9 - 6 = 3 skills. Write them down on your character
sheet or a scrap of paper under ``good at''.

Then, find out how many skills your character is \emph{bad at}. These
are 18 minus his age. If your character is 12, he's \emph{bad at}
18 - 12 = 6 skills. Record these under ``bad at''.

Those skills you have not chosen to be either \emph{good at} or \emph{bad
at}, you are\emph{ OK at}. We will deal with the exact meaning of
these in Chapter 3, Section 3.2.1. Right now, all you need to know
is that being \emph{bad at} a skill decreases your chances at completing
any tasks associated with that skill because it \emph{downgrade}s
your dice. Being \emph{good at} a skill \emph{upgrades} your dice.

As you can see, the older your character is the more skills they will
be \emph{good at} and the less skills they will be \emph{bad at}.
That makes perfect sense, though it makes younger characters weaker.
In the next section titled ``Chits'', you will find a system that
somehow compensates for that, \emph{especially} if the player is smart
and creative.


\subsubsection*{In short}
\begin{itemize}
\item A player character is \emph{good at} as many skills as his age minus
6. 
\item A player character is \emph{bad at} as many skills as 18 minus his
age.
\item The player chooses freely the skills he is \emph{good at} or \emph{bad
at}. He records these on the character sheet.
\item Any skill not chosen as either \emph{good at} or \emph{bad at} is
an \emph{OK at} skill. The player may record these on the character
sheet for reference.
\end{itemize}
Choose wisely. If your character is \emph{bad at} Fisticuffs, he'd
better be \emph{good at} Athletics. Did you notice the attributes'
abbreviations in brackets next to the skill name? These are important.
I will be telling you more, but just so you know, being \emph{good
at} Riding, a skill of Agility, makes your Agility dice better when
you are riding bikes, while being \emph{bad at} Riding, will make
your Agility dice worse. So, if you have a lot of dice in Agility,
being \emph{good at} Riding will make you a fantastic racer, but if
you have few and bad dice in Agility, you'll only be average.


\subsubsection*{Can you read?}

If your character is \emph{bad at} Academics he can't read. If your
character is \emph{good at} Academics he can read perfectly.

If your character is \emph{OK at} Academics\emph{, }he can read, but
might misunderstand a few things. The game master may ask you to check
your\emph{ }Academics\emph{ }skill any time you try to read something
more difficult than a children's book. 


\section{Chits}


\subsection{What are chits?}

Chits are points a player can use to buy favors from the game master,
such as rolling dice again or making dice stronger. Chits can also
be used to avoid death or change the flow of the story, at an increased
cost. Don't be too happy spending them, because chits are hard to
refill. If you run out of\emph{ }chits your character could become
a crybaby who would rather whine than try hard at anything. 

I will be sharing more about chits later in Chapter 5, \eqref{cha:Chits}
but for now know that the more you have the better.


\subsection{How many chits you begin with}

You begin with as many chits as 20 minus your character's age. If
your character is 12, you have 8 chits; if your character is nine
you have 11 chits, and so on. 

During the game, you will be able to earn more chits and share them
with other players. The maximum number of chits you can have at any
time is twice as much the starting\emph{ }chits of your character's
age. This maximum does change as your character grows older in the
game. If you begin at nine years of age your maximum number of chits
will decrease from 22 to 20 (twice the starting chits for a 10-year-old).


\subsubsection*{In short}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use chits to buy favors from the game master.
\item \emph{Every player character begins with 20 minus age chits (20 -
Age).}
\item Player characters can have up to as many chits as twice the starting
chits for their character's age.
\item Only player characters can have chits.
\end{itemize}

\section{Equipment}

The characters of this game are poor orphans and they have to earn
the money for their own bread and butter. Even so, they begin the
game with a few items and some money.


\subsection{Dress up or fade away}

First, let's see how well-clothed you are. Roll two normal dice and
check the number you get in the following table. 


\subsubsection{\noindent \hfill{}Clothes Table\hfill{} \label{sub:Clothes Table}}

\medskip{}


\hfill{}%
\begin{tabular}{cc}
\toprule 
Dice (nd) & Clothes Grade\tabularnewline
\midrule
\midrule

\midrule 
3 to 4 & B\tabularnewline

\midrule 
11 to 12 & E\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}\hfill{}

\medskip{}

\begin{quote}
\noindent What do these letters A to E mean? A = best quality, while
E = worst. Leave it to your imagination to provide the details, however,
some suggestions follow:\end{quote}
\begin{description}
\item [{E-Grade~Clothes~Kit:}] If your character is wearing E-grade clothes,
he looks just like Oliver Twist did right after arriving in London.
He owns a shirt, knee-long breeches and his underwear; that's that.
He is barefoot, which could be nasty in winter%
\footnote{That aside, being barefoot is not much of an issue. It's normal for
children to go barefoot in New Paris City; even outdoors. But don't
expect to be admitted to any fashionable place without decent shoes,
and don't even think about selling some of the most expensive papers,
you street rat. %
}. Oh, and don't get me started about his undies. 
\item [{D-Grade~Clothes~Kit:}] If your character is wearing D-grade clothes
he looks a bit better, but not much. He has everything the E kit has,
plus he gets a worn-out jacket and a newsboy cap, and perhaps some
ragged boots or shoes, reserved for foul weather. Besides all that,
I'm afraid that probably some piece of his clothing is two sizes larger
or smaller than you want.
\item [{C-Grade~Clothes~Kit:}] If your character is wearing C-grade clothes,
he looks like the average child of a working family on his way to
the factory or, if he's lucky enough, to school. If a boy, he wears
a shirt, his pants%
\footnote{Long or short is your choice, but mind the weather.%
}, a jacket, a newsboy cap, a pair of shoes and socks. A girl would
own a simple dress with long stockings, plain shoes and some headgear.
Everything is of plain color, but reasonably clean and well made.
You will not need to worry about winter with these clothes; it could
still feel cold, though. Characters wearing C-grade clothes and worse
will only own two sets of underwear, so they need to wash these thoroughly
every night... or pretend to do so.
\item [{B-Grade~Clothes~Kit:}] This grade of clothes is a little better.
It includes everything a C-grade clothes kit has, plus extras such
as a waistcoat, a cheap handkerchief with your initials sewn on it
and a scarf for winter. You also have plenty of underwear, so you
don't need to get your undies clean every night. A B-grade clothes
kit also includes an old C-grade clothes kit.
\item [{A-Grade~Clothes~Kit:}] It is a rare sight to see a newsboy in
this rich-boy outfit. It includes everything B-grade clothes have,
but items are much better made and with brighter colors. Wearing this
outfit is how you want to sell \emph{The Hawk} or some other fancy
newspaper in Benjamin Franklin's park. In A-grade clothes you pretty
much look like Little Lord Fauntleroy, which is generally best anywhere
but in dark alleys. An A-grade clothes kit also includes an old C-grade
clothes kit.
\end{description}

\subsection{Wealth}

Your character will want to buy things, and the best way to know if
he can afford something is to determine how much money he has. I will
be sharing the exact details in Chapter 4. Right now, all you need
to do is roll a couple of dice, add your character's age and multiply
the total by 10. The result is how many cents your character begins
with.


\subsubsection*{In short}
\begin{itemize}
\item Starting wealth~=~(\,2\,dice~+~age\,)\,x\,10~cents\end{itemize}
\begin{description}
\item [{Example:}] Anne is creating Tom, a newsboy, who is 12. She rolls
two dice, getting a 7. Now, 7\,+\,12\,=\,19, which means Tom begins
with 19\,x\,10\,=\,190 cents or \$1.90.
\end{description}

\subsection{Other useful stuff\label{sub:Other-useful-stuff}}

There is nothing as full of wonder as the pockets of a child. Well,
to be completely honest, full of wonder and plain, old-fashioned garbage.
Instead of buying or choosing your equipment before the game, you
must roll in the Random Stuff Table. If the dice show their uglier
sides to you, remember that even the most seemingly insignificant
item can be gold in the hands of a lively mind. 

Roll two \emph{normal} dice, but this time don't add them. Instead,
choose one to be the first die and the other to be the second die.
Check the table, knowing that the first die will be the first number
and the second die will be the second number. If you rolled a 1 with
your first die and a 4 with your second die, check the ``1-4'' box
in the following table; you get a notebook. If you rolled a 3 and
a 2 with your dice, the ``3-2'' box will provide you with some yummy
sausages.

\emph{You must roll at least once, and up to seven times on the Random
Stuff Table}. Be careful, because if you roll a double six (6-6) you
lose everything, including your money, and you will not be able to
roll again.

\subsubsection*{\medskip{}
Notes}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Roll two normal dice to determine how many sausages you get.
\item NPET stands for New Paris Elevated Train company, the main New Paris
transportation system. Each NPET token is good for one-way travel
to anywhere in New Paris. 
\item Good for four letters addressed anywhere within the state of New Paris.
\item Old and rusty, but working. 
\item A small cute and harmless animal.
\item You've been robbed and lost everything you got on the Random Stuff
Table. You lose all your money and your clothes rating drops to E.
\emph{You can't make any further roll on this table}. Tough luck!
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{In short}
\begin{itemize}
\item Roll for your clothes.
\item Roll for your money. You begin with (2\,dice\,+\,age\,)\,x\,10\,cents.
\item Roll at least once and up to seven times in the Fabulous Random Stuff
Table of 36 Miscellaneous Stuffous.
\item If you roll a double 6 you lose everything you acquired in the table.
\end{itemize}

\section{Background}

How did your character become a newsboy living on his own on the streets
of New Paris City? Everybody has a story. An interesting story can
help a poor orphan with a good imagination sell some newspapers. Beyond
that, knowing where you come from will make your character worth more
than a bundle of numbers and stats.

Are you really an orphan? If your parents are alive, then what about
them? Is your father in prison for life? You might want to keep that
to yourself, though. Is your mother locked in an asylum for her own
safety? Are they so poor the best thing they could do for you was
to buy you a ticket for New Paris City and pray? What became of your
brothers? Perhaps you could be the sibling of another character; just
ask another player if you think that would be cool. Were you born
in America or are you an immigrant? Were you born in New Paris City
or did you, as many others, travel there for the opportunity to make
your dreams come true? What are those dreams, by the way? Fancy to
be a lawyer, perhaps the president despite all odds, or do you want
to try your chances at baseball?

Add all the details you want and write them down on your character
sheet. If you can only think of a couple, that's alright. You can
always add to your character's story as you play the game. But please,
do speak with your game master to check that your family story fits
the adventure. He might be thinking of a story about kids who just
arrived from Europe, or about the children of a scientist murdered
by a nefarious rival or...

If you aren't that sure where your character is from you \emph{may}
want to use the Background Table that follows. Roll three normal dice,
thrice. The first roll will determine where you are from. The second
and third will see what happened to your mother and father.

\end{longtable}\hfill{}

\medskip{}


Roll once for place of birth and once for each parent.
\begin{description}
\item [{Dead:}] Your father or mother is dead and unless the information
is wrong, there is nothing anybody can do about it.
\item [{Prison:}] Your father or mother is serving a very long sentence
in prison, possibly for life. You can only visit once a year and he
or she doesn't write you much. Yeah, it's kind of sad.
\item [{Hospital:}] Your father or mother suffers from a long-term sickness
that keeps him or her in the hospital or some other facility. If it's
not a transmissible or mental illness, you could be allowed to visit
once a week.
\item [{Missing:}] You don't know where your father or mother is. Perhaps
they did not come home from work one day, or their ship sank and the
body was never found. Or, maybe your parent had to run away from police,
criminals or creditors.
\item [{Unknown:}] You have no idea who your father or mother is. If you
know your father but not your mother, consider that your father was
simply somebody who cared for you, because he had a kind heart, or
perhaps to send you begging or to pick a pocket or two, just as Fagin
did with Oliver Twist. If both your parents are unknown, then you
spent your first years in an orphanage until you (or somebody else)
decided you were old enough to care for yourself.
\item [{Adventure:}] You aren't quite sure; maybe it's a story you made
up for yourself when you were very little. Perhaps somebody told you
just to comfort you, or you believe your parent is doing something
special. It could be that you are the secret son of a prince of some
small nation in central Europe, or that your mother is an elf or is
working in a mission somewhere far, far away.
\end{description}
In New Paris, as in real life, many newsies, bootblacks and young
peddlers live with their families. \emph{Player characters, however,
are all on their own}. Parents (uncles, grandparents and any adult
family member) are either dead, unknown, far away, locked in prison
or unable to help or make contact with the player character. In practical
terms, every player character in this game is an orphan.


\subsubsection*{In short}
\begin{itemize}
\item Figure out your character's story.
\item Remember that your character's parents and any other grownup members
of his family must not be able to help. They could be dead, sick,
in prison, lost in the jungle...
\item \emph{If you want,} you can roll on the Background Table.
\end{itemize}

\section{The pack}

\emph{Newsies \& Bootblacks} assumes all player characters are friends
who care for each other. So, it is a good idea for players to coordinate
themselves when they are designing their characters. Pay attention
to what each of you is going to be \emph{good at} or \emph{bad at}.
Ask the game master for hints about what could be needed in the game.
If the game master says the adventure is all about spies, then you'd
probably want to be \emph{good at} Stealth or Languages. Think what
could happen if everybody was \emph{bad at} Streetwise.

Also, you should have a story explaining why you are all friends.
Some of you could be siblings or cousins. Perhaps you all arrived
in New Paris on the same ship from Europe and your parents died on
the journey. Usually, you just met in the streets, got along well
and decided to be friends. Or, there could be other reasons. Perhaps
the game master wants you to meet in the first scene you play in the
adventure. Be sure to ask your game master first.


\subsubsection*{In short}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ensure your characters make a good team.
\item Make up your own pack story.
\item That's that!
\end{itemize}
Now that you have your characters ready to go sell some papers and
save the world at the same time, the question is, are you up for the
challenge?


\section*{Character creation: an example}

Let me guide you as I create a character using the rules I've just
outlined in this chapter. First of all, I roll one single die to determine
my character's age. The result is a 4, so my character's age is 4+8
= 12. I decide my character is a boy and his name is Allan Krebs.

Then I need to buy dice to choose his attributes (age + 7). He's 12,
so I have 12 + 7 = 19 attribute points (AP) to buy dice. I decide
to buy only weak dice (wd), as they give more bang for the buck. I
buy three wd for Strength, two wd for Health (so Allan is a little
weak), three wd go to Agility, four wd to Education (I want Allan
to be smart), three wd for Eyes \& Ears, and the last four wd go to
Charisma. No attribute has more than four dice and each one has at
least one, as the rules command.

His attributes are now finished:
\begin{quote}
Strength = three wd, Health = two wd, Agility = three wd, Education
= four wd, Eyes \& Ears = three wd, Charisma = four wd
\end{quote}
Then I decide which skills Allan is \emph{good at} and \emph{bad at}.
As he is 12, he's g\emph{ood at} 12 \textendash{} 6 = 6 skills. I
choose Academics, Sweet Talk, Observation, Streetwise, Athletics and
Shooting. He'll be \emph{bad at} 18 \textendash{} 12 = 6 skills. I
choose Pickpockets, Locks (he's no thief), Vehicles, Mechanics, Crafts,
(he's not good at fixing stuff) and Riding.

He'll be \emph{OK at} the remaining nine skills. These are Climbing,
Dodging, Fisticuffs, Healing, Performance, Languages, Stealth, Swimming
and Throwing. I don't need to write these on the character sheet,
but I'm going to do it anyway to speed up the game.

Allan is \emph{good at} Academics, and that means he can read well
enough to not need to check for his Academics skill when trying to
read any text in English. 

Allan is 12 and that means he will begin with 20 - 12 = 8 chits. His
maximum number of chits is twice this number, or 16.

Let's see about his stuff now. I roll two dice for his clothing, using
the Clothes Table and argh, I got an 8!; that means Allan's clothes
are of the lowly D grade. He's barefoot%
\footnote{He's saving up his shoes for winter.%
} and his clothes could use a little mending and cleaning, I'm afraid. 

Money, that's what I want. Allan is 12 and I roll an 8 on two dice
so I get (12\,+\,8)\,x\,10\,cents = 20\,x\,10\,cents = 200\,cents
or \$\,2.00.

I decide to try my luck with the Random Stuff Table, rolling seven
times (the maximum). On my first roll I get a 3 and 5, a 3-5 which
means six candles. I make another six-dice throw and get six more
candles, a pack of expensive sweets; let's make them Turkish Delights
(I confess myself a Narnian in spirit), a harmonica (that's cool)
a notebook and a bowl; a curious mix.

Finally, I see to my character's background. I'm not sure of where
I want him to be from, so I roll using the Background Table as a guide.
I roll an 11, so he's from the Inner Expanses. Then, I roll again
to determine his father's and mother's background, getting a 12 and
a 13; they are both missing.

I note everything down on the character sheet and Allan is now ready
for a great adventure in New Paris. 


\section{Special cases}


\subsection{Hotel staff}

Maids, hotel boys, apprentice cooks and other hotel staff have much
less freedom than a newsboy. They work all day, live at the premises
and take orders from everybody else. In exchange, they get a uniform,
a weekly wage, decent meals and a bed in a shared room. If they work
hard and do well enough, they could raise in the ranks and become
a hotel manager. These jobs are not easy to get.

Hotel staff characters are created using the same rules as \emph{Newsies},
with the following differences:
\begin{enumerate}
\item They get a B-grade uniform; those working for a luxury hotel get an
A-grade hotel boy or maid uniform. They can keep it, even if robbed,
as the hotel will replace it for them.
\item They cannot own animals of any kind.
\item They get an extra die to determine their starting wealth.
\end{enumerate}
As hotel staff characters are restricted to their hotels, any player
wishing to play them must first seek permission from the game master.
A game master might also want to run an adventure exclusively with
hotel staff characters.


\subsection{Bootblacks}

Bootblacks are those who make a living out of cleaning and waxing
boots and shoes. Many among them are also newsboys, providing both
services for some extra benefit and a lot of extra trouble. Bootblacks
are created just like newsboys, but they must somehow acquire a Bootblack
box. The Crafts skill is also a must for bootblacks and most trades.

Bootblacks are allowed in any game%
\footnote{That is, unless the game master or game group is thinking of something
very special.%
}, and always welcomed in the Newsboy Lodge.


\subsection{Messengers}

Messengers work for a telegraph company delivering cables from the
telegraph stations to clients anywhere in New Paris. Messenger boys
must be physically fit, able to read, own a bicycle (the company isn't
providing one, sorry) and be at least \emph{OK at} Streetwise. Messenger
boys trade the freedom of being a newsboy for weekly wages and a C-grade
uniform.

The game master may not allow messengers in the game, so check with
your game master first.


\subsection{Errand kids}

Errand kids work for companies, hotels, institutions or professionals,
doing errands and whatever else they are asked. While many errand
kids work for a single employer, player characters should most often
be of the independent kind, working for young lawyers and others who
cannot hire permanent assistants. While anybody can be an errand girl
or boy, good Charisma, being \emph{good at} Streetwise and Crafts,
owning a bicycle and having respectable clothing and manners do help.

Independent errand kids are always allowed in any game and welcomed
in the Newsboy Lodge. Mind that many newsies, bootblacks and other
kinds of street kids work as errand kids to supplement their income.

\section{This is how you play this game}

\noindent \begin{wrapfigure}{o}{0.5\columnwidth}%
\includegraphics[clip,width=0.4\textwidth]{NBFinalIllust/singer}

\caption{Street Singer}


\end{wrapfigure}%
\lettrine{S}{}ome friends are sitting at a table; one of them is
the game master, the rest are the players, each one playing the role
of a player character. The game master describes the scene:

\emph{``You enter the alley with soft feet and wild hearts, trembling
at what could be waiting for you among the shadows. The air is filled
with the stench of the putrid fruit piled against a corner. What could
be hiding behind it? Ghosts are supposed to exist only in fairy tales,
but right now you aren't so sure. Was that a step you heard? Tell
me, what are you going to do?\textquotedbl{}}

\emph{Rick, one of the player characters, decides to take the lead.
``I am going to shoot at the fruit pile with my slingshot and if
anything moves, I say we run away like crazy.\textquotedbl{}}

\emph{If the game master is sure about the success of an action he
grants a success and that's that; no dice required. If on the other
hand, the action is believed impossible, the game master forbids it. }

\emph{In this case the game master is sure that Rick can't miss hitting
the fruit pile. He answers ``OK, Rick\textquotedbl{}. You point and
shoot and the stone hits the rotting fruit pile. After a split second,
you all see a ferocious, rabid cat emerging from the fruit pile, foam
coming out of its mouth. Now tell me, what are you going to do?\textquotedbl{}}

\emph{The group's answer is unanimous: ``Run for it!\textquotedbl{}
Perhaps the game master is exaggerating a bit on his description of
the cat, but they aren't taking any chances with a rabid feline.}

Now the game master has a small problem; will the players be able
to outrun the cat through the maze of trash-ridden alleys? That's
why we have rules. They help you to decide who can do what and what
the results of those actions could be, striving to be fair, fast and
fun.


\section{Basic checks}


\subsection{Choosing the skill and the dice}

Basic checks%
\footnote{Also known as skill tests.%
} allow us to know whether a character has been successful when attempting
an action. It is one of the most used rules in every game session,
so pay attention.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Make sure you know what \emph{action} the player character is attempting
and what the \emph{consequences} of that action could be. For example:
if a player shoots a rat with his slingshot, the action would be shooting
and the possible consequences are either a hit or a miss -- and the
effects of that hit. The game master might want to ask the player
to make sure he understands what he's trying to do.
\item The game master is the only one who can determine the consequences
of any attempted action. 
\item The game master then determines which \emph{skill} is more appropriate
for the \emph{action} being attempted%
\footnote{Shooting is appropriate when the action is shooting a rat with your
slingshot. Academics is appropriate for reading.%
}. 
\item \emph{If there's no appropriate skill}, the game master should choose
an \emph{attribute} instead%
\footnote{Suppose a newsboy finds one of the first photographic inventions and
wants to take a picture of his friends. There is no skill for photography
so the game master might decide that you use your Education attribute
for this action.%
}. Again, the game master's decision is final.
\item Use the dice of the attribute linked to the skill, \emph{upgrading}
or\emph{ downgrading} them:

\begin{itemize}
\item If the character is \emph{good at} the appropriate skill, upgrade
the dice of the linked attribute. Weak dice become normal dice (OK
dice), while normal dice become swell dice. 
\item If the character is \emph{bad at} the appropriate skill, downgrade
the dice of the linked attribute. Weak dice become fool dice and normal
dice become weak dice. 
\item If the character is \emph{OK at} the appropriate skill, use the dice
of the linked attribute without any modifications.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\begin{description}
\item [{Example:}] \emph{Allan is }good at\emph{ Sweet Talk, a skill linked
to the Charisma attribute. He has four weak dice in his Charisma attribute.
When he tries any Sweet Talk action, such as asking a bootblack girl
for a date, he upgrades those four weak dice to four normal dice.}
\end{description}

\subsection{The target number}

The game master then determines a target number (TN). If the player
rolls equal or higher than the target number, he succeeds. If he rolls
less than the target number, he fails. A task of average difficulty
will demand a TN of 10, a very easy task could use a TN of 4, while
a difficult task can only be achieved with a TN of 14 or more. (Refer
to 3.2.2.1 Target Number Table.)
\begin{description}
\item [{Example:}] Suppose Rick is shooting a can with a slingshot. Since
Shooting is the appropriate skill for this, the game master chooses
it to carry out the action. Shooting is linked to Eyes \& Ears. Rick's
character sheet shows that he has three weak dice in Eyes \& Ears;
not so good. Yet, Rick is also \emph{good at} Shooting, so he upgrades
those three weak dice to normal dice. The game master announces that
hitting the can will require a TN of 11 because it's quite far away.
Rick rolls his three normal dice and gets a 13, hitting the can right
in the middle with a satisfying noise, watching as it falls and rolls
along the pavement. Had Rick been \emph{bad at} Shooting, he would
have had a problem because he would have downgraded his weak dice
to fool dice. It's hard to roll an 11 with three fool dice unless
you use some chits%
\footnote{Chits are discussed in Chapter \vref{cha:Chits} %
}. If Rick had been neither \emph{good at} or \emph{bad at} Shooting,
he would have used the three weak dice of his Agility score and had
some chance of hitting the can.
\end{description}

\subsubsection*{When to not roll dice}

If the game master is sure you will succeed (or fail), you don't have
to roll any dice. To speed up the game, the game master may decide
that a player character (not a non-player character) automatically
succeeds at an easy task. Reserve rolling dice for the important stuff
only. This is how it goes:
\begin{description}
\item [{Impossible~Tasks:}] The attempt is genuinely impossible, such
as flapping your arms to fly. The attempt fails automatically, whether
the dice is rolled or the chits are spent.
\item [{Trivial~Tasks:}] These are so easy, you are guaranteed to succeed.
The game master does not need to require a die roll, except if the
task is attempted under stress such as during a fight or in an emergency.
\item [{Very~Easy~Tasks:}] The game master may decide that the player
character succeeds automatically, except if the task is attempted
under stress such as during a fight or in an emergency.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Target Number Table}

This table is a guideline for the game master when he has to determine
a target number. You can use a TN of 5 or 7 if you think that would
be the most appropriate for any given situation%
\footnote{Note that average (normal) difficulty means average for an adult without
special training. Dressing a wound would be of average difficulty
using the Healing skill. In any case, these guidelines are not the
Bible. The game master can change this table or disregard it altogether.%
}. 

\begin{longtable}{cc}
\hline
\toprule 
Difficulty & Suggested Target Number\tabularnewline
\midrule
\hline
\endhead
\midrule 
Trivial & 4\tabularnewline
\midrule 
Very easy & 6\tabularnewline
\midrule

\midrule 
Hard & 12\tabularnewline
\midrule 
Very hard & 14\tabularnewline
\midrule 
Experts only & 15 or more\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}




\subsection{The fumble }

You fumble when you roll seven points lower than your target number,
or you roll a 1 with each and every one of your dice%
\footnote{It's a good thing that swell dice do not have any 1s. Plus, if you
have three weak dice in Education and you are \emph{good at} Academics,
it would be unlikely for you to fumble unless you face a difficult
task.%
}.

A fumble could not mean anything more serious than making a fool of
yourself before your friends; falling off your bike, tripping, or
answering to your teacher that King George the Fifth was the first
U.S. President. However, it could have very dear consequences, especially
when running away from a ghost or in a fight, so avoid attempting
actions where you could easily fumble.


\subsection{The fail}

You fail when you roll lower than your target number, but yet not
so bad as in a fumble.

A fail means you have not achieved your desired goals. If you fail
attacking somebody in a fight, you just miss your enemy, if you fumble,
your own strength could make you fall down, face first. Still, failing
can be tragic in some situations, like if you are trying to jump from
one window to the next.


\subsection{The success}

You achieve success when you roll equal or higher than your target
number, but yet you do not get a spectacular success.

A success means you have reached your desired goals, which in most
cases would be good enough.


\subsection{The spectacular success}

The spectacular success is the opposite of the fumble. \emph{You get
a spectacular success }when you roll seven points\emph{ }over the
target number\emph{, or you roll a 6 with each and every one of your
dice}.

A spectacular success gives you additional benefits; you'll sell newspapers
much faster (giving you time to do something else or just sell more
papers), you don't only know about George Washington, but you can
tell your teacher the size of his shoes. In an emergency, a spectacular
success could save the day.


\subsubsection*{In short}
\begin{itemize}
\item The player tells the game master what action his character is attempting.
\item The game master determines the appropriate skill to carry out that
action. If there is no appropriate skill, he chooses an attribute.
\item If the character is \emph{good at} the skill, he upgrades%
\footnote{Normal dice become swell dice and weak dice become normal dice.%
} the dice of his linked attribute. 
\item If the character is \emph{bad at} the skill, he downgrades%
\footnote{Normal dice become weak dice and weak dice become fool dice.%
} the dice of his linked attribute.
\item If the character is not \emph{OK at }the skill or is using an attribute,
he rolls the dice of the linked attribute without upgrading or downgrading
them.
\item The game master determines the target number of the action as he sees
fit%
\footnote{A TN of 10 is average, 14 is very hard and 6 is very easy.%
}. 
\item The player rolls his dice, adding the results. He succeeds if the
total is equal to or greater than the target number, and fails if
the total is less than the target number.
\item If the total is 7 points less than the TN or all your dice show 1s,
it's a fumble.
\item If the total is 7 points greater than the TN or all your dice show
6s, it's a spectacular success.
\item Fumbles carry additional penalties, while a spectacular success provides
extra benefits.
\end{itemize}

\section{Competitive tasks}

Now you know how to test if a character succeeds at any given task.
You ask the game master for a target number, you roll your dice, add
them up, and if you get as much as the target number or higher, you
succeed. What if two or more characters are competing to achieve the
same task? 

We could be trying to see who can run faster or sell the last newspaper
to the last client of the day. Each character rolls his dice and the
highest result wins. If two or more characters roll the same result
they perform equally well.

If the task was hard enough without competition, the game master might
assign a minimum target number. If no character achieves this minimum
they all fail. 
\begin{quote}
Let's suppose Tim and Pip are both taking an examination for the chance
to earn a scholarship at the New Paris Atelier School of Arts. There's
only one remaining scholarship and the school demands a minimum level
of skill for admittance. The game master determines both competitors
will need a TN of 15 or greater. Should they both fail, none of them
will receive the scholarship. 
\end{quote}
Those who fumble (TN - 7), lose automatically. Those who roll a spectacular
success (TN + 7), double their total. 


\subsubsection*{In short}
\begin{itemize}
\item For a competitive task, every character rolls his dice and the highest
total wins. 
\item The game master \emph{may} assign a minimum target number.
\item A fumble will lose automatically, while a spectacular success will
double the totals.
\item If both characters fail or fumble, there will be no winner.
\end{itemize}

\section{With a little help from my friends}

What if two or more characters are trying to help each other to achieve
the same task? First of all, the game master must make sure that teamwork
does indeed help in the given situation. Athletics or shooting are
examples of skills that are often individual in nature, while lifting
a carriage from the body of an unfortunate newsboy does indeed benefit
from as many arms as possible.

The game master determines the target number and one of the characters
is chosen to be the leader. The other characters are considered assistants.
The leader rolls his dice normally. The assistants roll theirs too,
but their results are halved, rounded up, and they then add all their
points to the grand total.

The game master may also assign a maximum number of helpers. 
\begin{quote}
Let's say that Tim and Pip are carrying a huge basket filled with
eggs, hopefully without breaking any. The game master determines this
is a feat of Strength and assigns a TN of 10. That's bad news for
Tim (STR two weak dice) and Pip (STR two weak dice), so they decide
to cooperate. Tim is chosen to be the leader and he rolls a 5 and
a 3, for a total of 8. Pip, the helper, rolls a 4 + 3 = 7, halved
to 3.5, rounded up to 4. The grand total is 8 + 4 = 12, which is greater
than the TN of 10, so they succeed.
\end{quote}

\subsubsection*{Fumble and spectacular success}

Any player who rolls a 1 on all of his dice causes the whole group
to fumble. The group can also fumble if the grand total is 7 under
the target number.

The group achieves a spectacular success if the grand total is 7 over
the target number, or if the leader rolls a 6 with all their dice
and nobody fumbles; if anybody fumbles, the whole group fumbles.


\subsubsection*{In short}
\begin{itemize}
\item The game master must agree that the task can be done in a group.
\item One of the characters is chosen to be the leader, the rest are considered
assistants.
\item The leader rolls his dice and adds them up normally.
\item The assistants roll their dice, but totals are halved and rounded
up.
\item Add the leader's and the assistants' rolls to find the grand total.
\item If the grand total is equal to or greater than the target number,
the group succeeds.
\item If anybody fumbles, the whole group fumbles.
\item If the grand total is lower than the TN - 7, it's a fumble.
\item If the grand total is greater than the TN + 7, it's a spectacular
success.
\end{itemize}

\section{Quick and dirty or slow and neat}

The game assumes that most tasks are instantaneous or can be accomplished
in less than two minutes. However, there are actions that require
time, which is in short supply in an adventure. What then? The game
master assigns a time frame to the action, according to his own good
sense. If the player wants to speed up their action \emph{just a little
bit} the game master should raise the TN by 1. If the player wants
to do the action in half the time, the game master should double the
target number.

If the players are happy with slowing down their actions \emph{just
a little bit} the game master may lower the TN by 1. If the players
want to act slowly and safely the game master should lower the TN
by 3.
\begin{quote}
\begin{onehalfspace}
Suppose the players need to know how much time it would take them
to do their homework%
\footnote{Normally, a player doesn't roll for doing homework, but these players
are trying to get to college eventually, so they want great grades.%
} for the Newsboy Lodge Night School. The game master decides that
it would normally take two hours. The players are not happy about
that, so they ask to speed up that time by one third for a final time
of one hour and 20 minutes. The game master thus determines that normally
to get an A in that homework they would require a TN of 8, but since
they are speeding up, he raises the TN by 1 to a total of 9.\end{onehalfspace}

\end{quote}

\subsubsection*{In short}
\begin{itemize}
\item If the players want to speed up their actions \emph{just a little
bit} the game master should raise the TN by 1. 
\item If the players want to act in half the time, the game master should
double the target number.
\item If the players are happy with slowing down their actions \emph{just
a little bit} the game master may lower the TN by 1. 
\item If the players want to act slow and safe the game master should lower
the TN by 5.
\end{itemize}

\section{Try again}

Most actions can be attempted more than once. In each case the game
master must be satisfied that the characters still have the time,
the materials and any other requirement. You can't try again with
a fine Chinese vase that fell down, rolled and broke into smithereens.
You can try again with a drawing that went wrong, provided you have
a pencil and an eraser. 

The game master will choose to use the same target number from the
first attempt \emph{unless there is a good reason} to change it. A
second or third attempt at escaping from the watch of kidnappers will
be harder as the criminals will have been alerted. On the other hand,
a second attempt at solving a mathematics question should be easier.

However, if you try again but fail, you must pay 1 chit for the opportunity
to attempt that same task again. 
\begin{quote}
Let's say Bobby is trying to pick the lock of a door to a room where
he is locked in. Unfortunately, he's \emph{bad at} Locks and has only
two weak dice in Agility. Since he is \emph{bad at} Locks his two
weak dice are downgraded to two fool dice. The game master asks him
for a TN of 8; difficult with just two fool dice. The player decides
to try again and the game master concedes he has a better chance to
pick the lock now that he's familiar with it, and lowers the TN to
7. Poor Bobby rolls his dice again and fails. Now, Bobby has heard
that the corpse with whom he shares the room where he's locked in,
is from Transylvania and he does not want to risk any legends of vampires.
So, he pays 1 chit for another go with a TN lowered to 6. This time
he succeeds%
\footnote{As you will learn in Chapter \vref{cha:Chits}, Bobby could have used
1 chit for a re-roll in any of his earlier attempts. He chose not
to do so because it was 9 a.m. (when a vampire sleeps), and he needed
to lower the target number.%
}. 
\end{quote}
Make sure the players understand that to try again is not the same
as re-rolling. When you re-roll, you are rolling your dice again for
the same action. If you try again you are making a new attempt%
\footnote{If the characters doing their homework in the earlier example decided
to try again, they would have had to erase everything they'd already
done and start over.%
}.


\subsubsection*{In short}
\begin{itemize}
\item When a character wants to try again, he attempts a task that he has
already tried and failed at.
\item The game master must be assured that the action is still possible. 
\item Have the characters used up the materials, tools and fuel, etc.?
\item The game master can adjust the target number of the action if any
successive attempt makes the action harder or easier.
\item If the player fails three times in a row, he must pay 1 chit for the
opportunity to have a fourth attempt.
\end{itemize}

\section{Fallen dice}

Any die that falls off the table \emph{when testing for a skill or
attribute} is read as a 1. Both players and the game master should
be careful when throwing their dice, for their own benefit.


\section{Detailed skill list}

As promised, here is the detailed skill list, organized by each skill's
linked attribute%
\footnote{There are no skills linked to Health.%
}. This list provides reference and guidelines for the game master
and players, so you don't have to memorize it%
\footnote{Please note that the Language skill works differently. In fact, it's
so special it has its own section.%
}.


\subsection{Strength skills}
\begin{description}
\item [{Fisticuffs\,(STR):}] Fisticuffs is the appropriate skill to use
when you get into a fight, as long as you fight with your own body
or use hand weapons such as a stick or a sword. You can use this skill
in a friendly wrestling competition or while mock boxing. Don't use
this skill for throwing a stone or using a slingshot. That action
is better reserved for Throwing and Shooting.\\
You can usually try again as long as you are not in a fight. However,
make each attempt harder by raising the TN by 1 if you don't rest
for at least five minutes.%
\footnote{You'll find more details on how to use Strength in Chapter \vref{cha:Fights,-Chases-and}%
}
\item [{Throwing\,(STR):}] Throwing is the skill of choice when you are
throwing anything, either a carefully crafted javelin or throwing
a knife to the most humble stone. \\
You can try again as long as you don't run out of objects to throw.
\end{description}

\subsection{Agility skills}
\begin{description}
\item [{Athletics\,(AGI):}] Athletics is the appropriate skill for any
action dealing with a sport or similar activity, not already covered
by more specific skills such as Climbing or Riding. So, when a character
is trying to climb a wall, play baseball or football, or jump over
a fence, this skill would, under most circumstances, be helpful.\\
A fumble in this skill can mean that you trip over yourself, perhaps
suffering a few cuts and bruises%
\footnote{See the Damage Table \vpageref{sub:TDamage-Scale.}%
}.\\
Athletics is also appropriate when the characters are trying to run
away from a criminal on foot, when participating in a race with their
friends, or when trying to arrive on time to catch the Elevated Train
or Subway. \\
You can usually try again unless you are involved in a competition.
\item [{Climbing\,(AGI):}] Climbing might be your last hope of escape
when cornered in a narrow alley. It's also useful when trying to sneak
into (or out of) a building, and to survive the most treacherous passages
of the New Paris sewers.\\
You can usually try again as long as you are not in a fight, but make
each attempt harder by raising the TN by 1 if you don't rest for at
least five minutes.
\item [{Dodging\,(AGI):}] Dodging is an ability mostly used in a fight
to avoid being hit, as discussed in Chapter \vref{cha:Fights,-Chases-and},
but it can also come in handy to avoid being run over by a train,
carriage or a horse. \\
You cannot try again to dodge the same attack.
\item [{Locks\,(AGI):}] This skill comprises the ability to open locks
and safes, \emph{provided you have the proper tools}. Opening the
door of a poor tenement house is relatively easy, requiring a TN of
12. A basic safety lock requires at least a TN of 13; a safe would
require at least a TN of 15. With improvised tools, increase the TN
by 3 to a total of 5.\\
A fumble means you have damaged your tools, making them unusable even
after they are properly repaired. You can usually try again unless
you don't fumble.
\item [{Pickpockets\,(AGI):}] This skill is useful for the obvious task
of stealing wallets, watches and expensive handkerchiefs while the
poor victim doesn't notice. Stealing from an unwary old lady should
demand a TN of 12, but who would be such a crook? However, stealing
from a wary policeman commands a TN of 16 or more. For other victims,
the game master should use his good sense.\\
A failure in this task indicates that the victim notices before you
get to steal anything. 
\item [{Riding\,(AGI):}] Riding includes the capacity to drive a bicycle,
for example, and the ability to maintain it. The Mechanics skill (not
Crafts) is also adequate to care for a bicycle, but not to ride it.
As with Climbing and Athletics, a fumble in this skill will usually
mean that you fall off your bike, perhaps suffering a few cuts and
bruises. \\
You can usually try again unless you are involved in a competition
or you are being chased.
\item [{Stealth\,(AGI):}] This skill comes in handy when playing hide-and-seek,
especially if the one who seeks you is little Pete and his pet Rottweiler.
In short, it's good for both hiding and moving silently without being
detected. \\
You cannot usually try again once you've been discovered.
\item [{Swimming\,(AGI):}] Only characters who are \emph{good at }Swimming
may swim in relatively calm waters without having to roll for this
skill. Everybody else must roll for Swimming when they are swimming
in water deeper than their height, with a TN of 8 for rough waters.
\\
Failure means that the player character cannot advance and must struggle
to keep himself afloat. \\
A fumble puts the character in immediate danger of drowning. In this
case, the player character must struggle for his life, rolling once
every minute. Any further failure means the player character would
drown in five minutes, unless rescued. 
\item [{Vehicles\,(AGI):}] The Vehicles skill is useful to operate and
maintain any land vehicle except a bicycle. This includes trains and
stagecoaches, but not riding a horse.\\
You can try again unless you are being chased or are undertaking some
competition.
\end{description}

\subsection{Education skills}
\begin{description}
\item [{Academics\,(EDU):}] Academics is a glorified term for school stuff.
History, Biology, Botanics, Philosophy and in general, all school,
high school and university subjects not covered by more specific skills
belong to Academics. Use this skill when a character wants to know
the meaning of some word, the poisonous effects of some plant or do
research in a library. \\
You can \emph{only} try agai'' if \emph{your character} is aware
that he has failed, he can consult reference works, or ask a learned
person such as a teacher.
\item [{Crafts\,(EDU)~and~Mechanics\,(EDU):}] Crafts covers all sorts
of traditional crafts, maintenance and repairs not related to electricity
or mechanics; sewing, carpentry, masonry, drawing, painting, etc.,
are covered by this skill. Crafts can be a pretty useful skill in
the hands of the right player, provided there are enough tools, materials
and time available. Repairing a train engine or some new wonder of
science such as a horseless carriage is covered by Mechanics.\\
A fumble at any of these skills lowers the quality of the item by
one level.%
\footnote{B-grade clothes downgrade to C, C-grade to D, D-grade to E and with
E, well, you better get a barrel or something.%
}\\
You can usually try again as long as the materials are not used up
by the attempt%
\footnote{You can try again as long as you have paper or an eraser handy.%
}. 
\item [{Healing\,(EDU):}] Healing covers everything from dressing the
leg of a puppy to minor surgery. Full details on how to use this skill
are covered on \vref{sub:Healing} 
\item [{Streetwise\,(EDU):}] Streetwise makes you aware of the places
and people you ought to know (or avoid) in New Paris.\\
You can't usually try again with this skill; if you don't know, then
you don't know.
\end{description}

\subsection{Eyes \& Ears skills}
\begin{description}
\item [{Observation\,(E\&E):}] Observation is a great skill to discover
someone trying to hide from you, trying to read a note in the dark
or recognizing a face among the crowd.
\item [{Shooting\,(E\&E):}] Shooting includes the skill to use and maintain
any weapon that shoots a missile of some sort.
\end{description}

\subsection{Charisma skills}
\begin{description}
\item [{Performance\,(CHA):}] Being \emph{good at} Performance helps you
to perform on the streets for a few dimes, juggle or even run a puppet
show for children. 
\item [{Languages\,(CHA):}] Languages is in fact, two skills in one: a)
how many languages you know well enough to have a basic conversation;
and b) communicating through mime and gestures. Note that standard
sign language is considered a language; not mime and gestures.\\
A character who is \emph{good at} Languages is entitled to test this
skill the first time he needs to use a foreign language. If the test
is successful the character can use that language. \\
Failure means the character is not able to communicate in that language
and will be limited to mime and gestures. The game master should assign
a target number using his good sense, taking into account the character's
background. A TN of 12 is suggested for common and easy languages;
while rare or hard tongues should get higher numbers. Note that this
test cannot be repeated without spending chits.\\
A character who is \emph{bad at }or\emph{ OK at} Languages can only
speak English.\\
You can only try again with this skill after spending at least one
week immersed in the language or after one month of intensive training.
\item [{Sweet~Talk\,(CHA):}] This skill is used to convince people to
agree with your opinions and make them do what you want them to do.
It can even be used, God forbid, to tell some untruthful story to
a policeman who may have just found you with a gold watch that just
\emph{accidentally} fell into your pocket. The target number varies
wildly; the story about a watch that \emph{accidentally} fell into
a newsboy's pocket should command a TN of 15, at the very least.\\
A fumble means the other person is angry enough that he would not
pay attention to your words for one full week, and it could have the
reverse consequences that you intended.\\
You can try again as long as you don't fumble, but don't forget that
each attempt raises the TN by 1.
\end{description}

\section{Scenes}

A scene is any goal attempted by a character or group of characters
that requires more than one simple action and involves more than one
skill. Normally, you role play and simulate each and every action
attempted. Sometimes, to speed up the game, the game master and the
players may agree to solve the whole scene with just one single dice
roll.


\subsection*{Rules}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The game master describes the situation as he or she always does,
and the players share what their characters intend to do, as usual.
\item A player or the game master proposes to solve the situation as a scene.
\item The game master assigns a number from 1 to 6 (or better), that the
players must roll in one single normal die. He warns the players of
the consequences if they fail.
\item The players vote. If at least half plus one of the players agree with
the proposal of the game master, accepting the possible consequences
of a failure, the situation can be solved as a scene; otherwise it
must be played as normal. 
\item The youngest player rolls the dice. 
\item Chits%
\footnote{The use of chits is explained in Chapter \vref{cha:Chits}%
} can only be used in scenes to buy re-rolls or to get a \emph{still
breathing} favor. Re-rolls for scenes are much more expensive, costing
2 chits per player.
\item The game master applies the consequences of success or failure according
to the result of the dice roll.\end{enumerate}
\begin{quote}
Let's suppose the player characters are following a suspected spy
to sneak into his hideout. That would require several skills (Stealth
and Observation) and actions. You would probably want to role play
that scene in detail, but let's suppose it's late in the evening and
you are running out of real time to play. After hearing the players'
plan and assessing the situation, the game master believes they have
a fair chance of succeeding. He tells the players they need to roll
a 4 or better with one normal die. If they fail, they will be captured
by the spy and imprisoned in some dirty cellar. The players are OK
with it, so they roll the dice. Unfortunately, they roll a 3 and buy
a re-roll, which comes expensive at 2 chits per player. 
\end{quote}

\section*{Example game session, continued}

Veteran role-players may already be familiar with the rules, as explained
before, but I will continue with the sample game session from Section
1.1.3, so you can see how I would implement them in a real game.
\begin{verse}
Martin: ``OK. So Daniel you stop right in time, but Tammy and James
walk confidently into a stream of water. It rises up to your elbows.
I'm sure you know what kind of water this is, do you?\textquotedbl{}

Daniel bursts into laughter.

Martin: ``Now Daniel, you might have heard something to your back.
Make another Eyes \& Ears check, please; the TN is just 11 this time.\textquotedbl{}

Daniel: ``OK, no problem. I'm \emph{good at }Observation and have
three weak dice, so I upgrade them. Three normal dice, thank you.\textquotedbl{}
Daniel rolls the dice. ``I've got a 4-6-3; that's 13.\textquotedbl{}

Martin: ``Higher than the target number, great. Daniel, definitely,
you've heard the steps of someone behind you. What do you do?\textquotedbl{}

Daniel: ``I turn around real fast.\textquotedbl{}

Martin: ``Daniel, as soon as you turn around, you see it just for
a second, a rat running fast and then fading away under the shadows.''

Tammy: ``Well, what do we do, now?\textquotedbl{}

Martin: ``Whatever you want, as always. I suggest you get out of
that... er... stream and see if you go north or south.\textquotedbl{}

James: ``Any hint of where the pickpocket went?\textquotedbl{}

Martin: ``Yes, too bad it's so dark down here.\textquotedbl{}

Daniel: ``I'm trying anyway.\textquotedbl{}

Martin: ``Well, it's a TN of 16 this time. You'd better have some
good rolling of dice.\textquotedbl{}

Daniel rolls his dice: ``Hey, got all 6s!\textquotedbl{}

Martin: ``A spectacular success. Daniel, by sheer luck you spot er...
25 cents spread southwards in pennies.\textquotedbl{}

Tammy: ``Great, Daniel. Now, grab the money and go fetch him!\textquotedbl{}

James: ``I think we should make a torch first. Martin, is there anything
we can use to make a torch from the stuff around here?\textquotedbl{}

Martin: ``Hmm, that would be too much luck...\textquotedbl{}
\end{verse}

\chapter{Wealth and stuff\label{cha:Wealth-and-stuff.}}

\lettrine{U}{}nless the game master decides otherwise, player characters
are supposed to be able to provide for themselves regularly. Most
newsboys (and girls) will live at the Newsboy Lodge or some similar
institution, where they can stay and receive basic meals for a token
payment. In other words, we assume that the player characters are
able to earn their basic upkeep selling their papers or working in
whatever other trade they have chosen for themselves.

Everything else however, even school, costs money and the player characters
should be aware of the cost and the consequences.


\section{Equipment rules}


\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{description}
\item [{\nomenclature{Large Object}{A large object is anything that would not fit inside a pocket. }Large~Object:}] A
large object is anything that would not fit inside a pocket. 
\item [{Small~Object:\nomenclature{Small Object:}{A small object is anything that would fit inside a pocket.}}] A
small object is anything that would fit inside a pocket.
\end{description}

\subsection{Limits}
\begin{itemize}
\item Large Object: A character can carry as many large objects as dice
he has allocated to Strength, whether these are weak or normal dice.
Using a bag or backpack doubles that number.
\item Small Object: A character can carry up to 12 small objects; if he
is using a bag or backpack, double that number.\end{itemize}
\begin{quote}
Note: These limits are as always, a guideline for the game master,
who can use his good judgment to disallow any newsboy to carry an
elephant as if it were just one large object.
\end{quote}

\subsection{Equipment quality}

In Chapter 2 you saw that there were five grades of clothes ranging
from A to E. We use a similar system for equipment, according to the
following guidelines:
\begin{itemize}
\item \nomenclature{Quality, A}{Good quality, 1st Class Service}A: Good
quality product; exclusive service.
\item \nomenclature{Quality, B}{Standard quality, 2nd Class Service}B:
Standard quality product; first-class service.
\item \nomenclature{Quality, C}{Cheap, mass produced product; 3rd Class Service.}C:
Cheap, mass-produced product; second-class service.
\item \nomenclature{Quality, D}{Second hand or badly manufactured product; questionable service like riding in a lifestock car.}D:
Second-hand or badly manufactured product; third-class safe.
\item \nomenclature{Quality, E}{Barely usable, worn out or unsafe product; unsafe service, like riding on the top of a train car.}E:
Barely usable, worn-out or unsafe product; unsafe service, such as
riding on the top of a train car.
\end{itemize}

\section{Rating prices}

Prices are going up and down all the time on New Paris streets; something
might be cheap in one shop and hugely expensive just around the corner.
As such, instead of giving an exact price for items and stuff, the
game master may choose to rate them according to the following scale:

\label{sub:Rating Prices Table}

\begin{longtable}{cccccc}
\hline
\toprule 
Rating & A & B & C & D & E\tabularnewline
\midrule
\hline
\endhead
\midrule 
Minimum value & \$10 & \$5 & \$1 & \$0.20 & \$0.01\tabularnewline
\midrule
\midrule 
Usual value & \$25 & \$7 & \$3 & \$0.50 & \$0.10\tabularnewline
\midrule
\midrule 
Maximum value & -- & \$15 & \$6 & \$1.50 & \$0.30\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}If the price of your pin is rated E, you could find it from 1 to 30
cents in shops. The game master should choose the exact price when
the player characters want to buy something. If in doubt, use the
usual value.
\begin{quote}
Inflation (rarely deflation) might change the values in the table.
A good, simple way to add stress to the player characters is to begin
a new adventure by telling the players that inflation has increased
all the prices. Newspaper sales are harder to make during an economic
crisis.

Please note that the quality grade of an item does not equal its price
grade. A gold pin could demand a C-grade price; while an E-grade steamship
could still be priced in the A-grade range.
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\item a) It does not count as an object if worn.
\item b) No shoes.

\item d) For pampered kids. Most boys build their own using their Crafts
skill, or they ask an older brother to build it for them.
\item e) School books printed in cheap newspaper-grade unbound paper for
the use of poor students. Meant to last for one school term only.
\item f) Includes two black pencils, an eraser, a wooden ruler, a cheap
48-page notebook, sandpaper (to use as a pencil sharpener), a simple
pen and a case.
\item g) Given for free to the newsies with higher sales; has newspaper's
logo.
\item h) Proper medication add +2 to Health or Healing rolls (See Chapter
9: Section 9.6.6).
\item i) Urban Transportation, 1 fare.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Stuff you cannot buy}

This is a list of steampunk items that you cannot find in any shop.
Instead the characters will only have access to them in the course
of their adventures.

As always these are only examples, feel free to add new items or modify
the existing ones in your own adventures.

Being prototypes they are all of D-grade quality.
\begin{enumerate}
\item OWL Walking Camera. A camera in the shape of a wooden owl. It can
walk slowly following a preset pattern (as in walk five feet, rotate
left 90 degrees). Clockwork walking autonomy 100 yards. The OWL will
take one photo every 10 yards or at a specific times, as set by its
operator.
\item Electric Torch. A hand-sized electric torch, the last of the last
in illuminating technology! 
\item Portable Miniature Phonograph. To record and play conversations. Must
be winded. It holds a small cylinder which can hold up to five minutes
of recording. 
\item Miniature Electric Motor. It serves to wind other mechanisms or to
power miniature vehicles. 
\item Miniature Phone with cable. Once hooked to a line it can be used to
call anywhere. 
\item Miniature Magnetic Detector. It detects coin-sized metal objects up
to 12 inches away.
\item Doggy. A electric powered dog, wire guided (wire unwinds up to 24
yards) Batteries charge in six hours, last one hour. Doggy can be
fitted with OWL, Electric Torch, and Portable Photographer. It's nose
will turn red if it detects harmful chemicals. 
\item Blue Poison Tranquilizer Pistol. 
\item Dr. Wisemore's Thin-Rope (24 yards). Can hold up to 200 kilos. Must
be used with gloves. Almost invisible. 
\item Dr. Uranus Flash and Smoke Pills. These pills look like any ordinary
medication. When thrown to the ground they will explode, liberating
a 10-cubic foot smoke cloud that will dissipate in three seconds. 
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Chits\label{cha:Chits}}

\lettrine{T}{}he player characters of this game are luckier than
average. It's like the world wants to compensate them for having it
rough. Perhaps their guardian angels are better than average. Explain
it however you wish. In any case, when things get really tough they
more often than not, escape safe and sound until their special star
fades.

Good acts, especially heroic deeds, can recover the favor of the angels,
making that special star shine again and recover or even gain chits
up to the character's maximum.

Chits offer a major advantage to the smart player who is able to use
them creatively. True, sometimes the best you can do, is to re-roll
a critical dice throw, but there are other strategic options that
pay better in the long run. 


\section{Using chits}

When a player character wants to purchase one favor, he announces
it to the game master, who must then approve the request. The game
master would do so, as long as the player is not asking for anything
weird, uncanny, unsporting or against the rules. The player then pays
the favor's price in chits to the game master, who will then grant
it. The benefits of such a favor should be narrated in a way that
shows the role that luck played%
\footnote{The game master will say something like, ``Luckily, the bullet is
defective and drops to the ground, harmlessly.\textquotedbl{} Or,
``The assassin forgot to load his revolver.\textquotedbl{} Or whatever
feels appropriate to the situation.%
}. 

You may use markers, pawns or fake money to represent chits, or you
could simply keep track of them on the character sheet.

The following table details how many chits you can use for any such
favor. You aren't limited by the table; the players should feel free
to ask for any favor not listed in this table, as long as the game
master approves them... for a fair price in chits.

\end{tabular}
\par\end{center}


\subsection*{Explanations}


\subsubsection*{\emph{Something nice happens}}

For 1 chit, you can have an event happen that would require some help
in any given situation. For more substantial help you need to pay
3 chits, as discussed in \emph{Something helpful happens}. In any
case, this event must be plausible and make sense.
\begin{quote}
Examples of nice events include: A kind old lady buys you an apple
when you are hungry, or a small brave dog comes to your defense in
a fight. Perhaps you are seeking employment and a lawyer trusts you
to deliver some important documents to a client. If you do it well,
you'll have earned yourself a job. Maybe the common hospital room
is filled and you get your private room, just like the rich kids,
or perhaps you meet a friendly Civil War veteran just two days before
your American History exam at the night school.
\end{quote}

\subsubsection*{\emph{Give me a clue}}

For 1 chit you can ask the game master to give you a clue about some
secret or mystery, or some other element of the plot. The game master
can be as straightforward or enigmatic as the story requires. For
example: instead of just saying \textquotedblleft{}The butler did
it\textquotedblright{}, the game master could say something like \textquotedblleft{}The
master of politeness is stained in red\textquotedblright{}.


\subsubsection*{\emph{Ha! Missed me}}

For 1 chit you can dodge any attack delivered by a non-lethal weapon
or any unarmed attack (such as a kick). The attack is assumed to have
failed, so your character can act normally. 


\subsubsection*{\emph{Re-roll}}

Choose any dice you have already rolled and re-roll them at a cost
of 1 chit per die. You can re-roll all your dice for a total cost
of 3 chits.


\subsubsection*{\emph{Still breathing}}

When the game master announces your character is dead for any reason,
you can pay 1 chit to keep them alive. However, he is still gravely
injured and unable to stand up, so it could be wiser to pay 2 chits
for the ``Just Hurt'' favor. 


\subsubsection*{\emph{Double or nothing}}

Just as it says, pay 1 chit for the opportunity to double the result
of all your dice. The whole thing is a gamble that could turn against
you if you are unlucky again. See how it goes.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If after rolling your dice you don't like the results and want a chance
for \emph{Double or nothing}, you tell the game master.
\item He then would announce what is at stake. Usually you would lose 1
or 2 extra chits and fumble at your attempt. However, the game master
could say your character is hurt, or might fail spectacularly before
all your friends. If you agree with the consequences, you spend your
chit and roll one normal die. 
\item On an even result you can double your original throw. 
\item On an odd result however, you'll face the consequences that the game
master announced.\end{enumerate}
\begin{quote}
Let's say you are playing baseball. You rolled a mere 8 (according
to the game master, just enough to advance to first base). However,
the game master told you that a 15 would grant you a home run and
you desperately want that. So, you announce that you are taking your
chances at \emph{Double or nothing} and want to know what the consequence
of failure could be. The game master, perhaps in a mischievous mood,
announces that if you don't roll higher than your original throw,
your pants will fall down for the general merriment of your friends
and rivals watching the game. Plus, you'll have to pay 1 extra chit.
You agree to those terms and re-roll. Thankfully, this time you roll
a 4 (an even result), and double your original throw for a total of
8 x 2 = 16 chits; more than enough for a home run.
\end{quote}

\subsubsection*{\emph{Let me try something cool}}

Sometimes you just need to do something cool, like jumping on a horse
and then through a window to dodge a particularly nasty bully. The
problem is that the game master can assign an impossible target number
to such daredevil actions. In that case you can pay 1 chit to lower
that TN to 12.

\smallskip{}
The game master must agree that:
\begin{itemize}
\item a) Your action is cool enough (dangerous is not always cool); and
\item b) It has to be physically possible (even if unlikely) for a human.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{\emph{Found it!}}

Whenever your character needs an item that's reasonable for him to
own or somehow find, you can pay 2 chits and your character will either
have it in his pockets or find it easily somewhere. The object must
not weigh more than five pounds or cost more than \$1 per chit%
\footnote{A 20-pound item will cost you 4 chits and 3 chits will buy you a \$3
coat.%
} spent. 


\subsubsection*{\emph{I'm a hero}}

For heroic actions in which your character, out of the goodness of
his heart and without motive for any reward, risks his life for the
sake of others or some noble ideal, you can pay 1 chit to lower the
TN to 10.\smallskip{}


As in \emph{Let me try something cool} the game master must agree
that: 
\begin{itemize}
\item The action is heroic enough; and
\item It has to be physically possible (however unlikely) for a human.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{\emph{Each extra weak die}}

Before or after you roll the dice, 2 chits buy one extra weak die
to roll immediately before your throw. This extra die is lost as soon
as it is used. 


\subsubsection*{\emph{Just hurt}}

You can pay 3 chits to reduce a grave or dead damage result to hurt
on the damage scale%
\footnote{You will see more information about damage in Section \vref{sub:TDamage-Scale.}.%
}. You could say the bullet did not touch a vital organ, the sword
did not cut as deeply as it looked or that you fell on soft ground.
In any case, you only received half as much damage.


\subsubsection*{\emph{Something helpful happens}}

For 3 chits, you can ask the game master for a helpful event to happen.
This event must be plausible without recourse to fantasy. It must
make sense, so restrain yourself as it cannot fully solve the situation
on its own. For example: if you are selling papers good weather would
definitely help, but you can't get someone to buy all your bundles
no matter how good your excuse is. In any case, the game master's
opinion is final on this matter.
\begin{quote}
Examples of helpful events include: A nurse on his way to the hospital
finds you hurt and decides to help; an angry wolfhound appears just
between you and the muggers who would rob you; the train you were
about to miss is delayed; the thundering rain which was going to doom
paper sales stops until you finish your last bundle; your court case
is assigned to a judge who has a soft spot for newsies, or while shopping
for new boots a new shoe shop opens and everything is selling at 25\%
off. 
\end{quote}

\subsubsection*{\emph{Each extra swell die}}

Before or after you roll, 3 chits buy one extra swell die. You must
roll your new die immediately and add the result to your throw. 


\subsubsection*{\emph{Triple or nothing!}}

Just as it says, pay 3 chits for the opportunity to triple all your
dice. The whole thing is a gamble that could be turned against you
if you are unlucky again. See how it goes.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If after rolling your dice you don't like the results and want a chance
for \emph{Triple or nothing!}, just tell the game master.
\item The game master then announces what is at stake. Usually you'd lose
3 to 5 extra chits and fumble at your attempt. Although, the game
master might say your character could be hurt, die or just fail spectacularly
before all your friends. If you agree with the proposed consequences,
you spend your 3 chits and roll one normal die. 
\item On an even result you can double your original throw. 
\item On an odd result however, you'll face the consequences that the game
master announced.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{\emph{Just a scratch}}

At the cost of four chits you can trade the effects of any injury
for a -1 malus%
\footnote{Refers to the level of sickness. You will see more information about
damage in Section 6.7.%
}. This is a pretty expensive option so use it with care. You can't
use it for any previous injuries or for accumulated damage; it must
be used immediately after your character has been hurt.


\subsubsection*{\emph{Can't touch me}}

For five chits your character can survive any single attack or accident,
suffering no effects whatsoever.


\subsection*{New favors}

The game master can grant any favors not included in this list at
a reasonable cost in chits. 


\subsubsection*{In short}

When your player needs a favor, refer to the favor table, pay the
chits and follow the rules. If the favor is not included in the table,
the game master may (or may not) concede at a reasonable cost in chits,
using the table as a guideline.


\subsection*{An example game session, continued}

So, we continue our adventure from the end of Chapter 3:
\begin{verse}
Martin: ``A spectacular success. Daniel, by sheer luck you spot er...
25 cents spread southwards in pennies.\textquotedbl{}

Tammy: ``Great, Daniel. Now, grab the money and go fetch him!\textquotedbl{}

James: ``I think we should make a torch first. Martin, is there anything
we can use to make a torch from the stuff around here?\textquotedbl{}

Martin: ``Hmm, that would be too much luck...\textquotedbl{}

James: ``OK, I'm pushing my luck here. Martin, what if I pay you
1 chit?\textquotedbl{}

Martin: ``Make it 3, and it's a deal.\textquotedbl{}

Tammy: ``Three? For one stupid torch?\textquotedbl{}

Martin: ``One stupid torch that you need now. A torch that could
be quite handy, you know.\textquotedbl{}

Daniel: ``I think 2 chits is fair for a torch.\textquotedbl{}

Martin: ``OK, it's 2 chits, but that's final. Take it or leave it.\textquotedbl{}

James: ``I take it. Here's my 2 chits.\textquotedbl{}

Martin: ``Great, thank you. You all start searching for materials
to make a torch but there's nothing you can see around here. Finally,
as you are about to give up, James steps on something and falls on
the ground, landing on his bottom.%
\footnote{Usually, James would have checked Agility to avoid such a fate, but
as this is just for fun, the players are letting the game master get
away with it.%
}
\end{verse}

\section{Earning chits}

The initial supply of chits might seem generous, but because they
can run out quickly, you'll be happy to know there are a few ways
of replacing them. Chits are not earned easily, as you will see in
the table below.

\begin{description}
\item [{Act~of~Kindness:}] As every newsboy knows, God helps those who
are kind and good. This might not agree with your opinion about real
life, but that's the way it works in this game. When a character performs
a random act of kindness towards somebody who is not a friend and
cannot easily answer in kind, roll a normal die. If you roll a 5 or
a 6, you earn 1 chit. The game master must be satisfied that the act
is appropriate to the adventure, is ethical and demands significant
effort from the character%
\footnote{Giving a flower to a homeless lady is nice, but will not grant you
the chance of getting a chit. Spending half an hour to find the parents
of a five-year-old girl who is lost in the city would.%
}. 
\item [{Helping~a~Rival:}] If you help somebody who is definitely not
a friend or rival in some kind of competition, you get 1 chit. Another
newsboy who makes fun of you because you sell less qualifies as a
rival. That straight-A student who tells the whole world every time
you get a C or worse, qualifies as a rival. A friend who sometimes
makes a joke, does not. When helping a rival you must not do anything
unethical or that would unlawfully harm anyone else. Again, the game
master must be satisfied that the act is appropriate to the adventure,
is ethical and demands significant effort from the character. 
\item [{Helping~an~Enemy:}] An enemy is the most serious form of rival.
Examples of enemies include a bully who is after you, a crooked cop,
somebody who has robbed you, and so on. Again, when helping a rival
you must not do anything unethical or that would unlawfully harm anyone
else. You don't get 3 chits just by helping a gang kidnap a pastor.
The game master must be satisfied that the act is appropriate to the
adventure, is ethical and demands significant effort from the character.
\item [{Heroic~Generosity~and~Outstanding~Honesty:}] This time the
game master must not only be satisfied that the act is appropriate
to the adventure, is ethical and demands significant effort from the
character; the action must be extraordinary. Ordinary honesty, like
not shortchanging or keeping your word does not grant you any chits.
Returning a wallet you found on the street with \$20 or confessing
a crime when nobody has a clue you did it, would indeed qualify. Likewise,
heroic generosity means an extraordinary effort either in money or
kind. For example: spending a full week volunteering at a soup kitchen
for eight hours a day, donating a full week's earnings or sharing
your food even when you are hungry.
\item [{Winning~the~Adventure:}] Once the game master is satisfied the
players have finished an adventure successfully, he will grant a number
of chits to the whole gaming group. It is the players' responsibility
to divide the whole lot as they believe is fair. Some groups may simply
divide the points evenly, while others may choose to reward the best
players, or the one who brought the pretzels and soda. The exact number
of chits will vary from adventure to adventure. Generally, the harder
the adventure is the more chits the group will receive.
\item [{Saved~a~Life:}] When a player character makes a significant effort
by taking an action that decisively helps rescue somebody from certain
danger, he earns 3 chits.
\item [{Heroic~Feat:}] Two chits are awarded to any heroic feat that does
not lead to saving a life.
\item [{Major~Festivities:}] On specific days such as Christmas, there
is so much fun and goodwill that your character recovers his energies
and optimism. For details refer to Chapter 8. \ref{sec:Seasons}
\item [{A~Stranger~Helps~You:}] If a non-player character who does not
know your character helps you when you are in some great trouble,
you receive 2 chits. The game master should use this option only when
a player is in dire straits, not to reward careless playing.\end{description}
\begin{quote}
\emph{\textquotedbl{}In fact, if it had not been for a good-hearted
turnpike-man, and a benevolent old lady, Oliver's troubles would have
been shortened by the very same process which had put an end to his
mother's; in other words, he would most assuredly have fallen dead
upon the king's highway. But the turnpike-man gave him a meal of bread
and cheese; and the old lady, who had a shipwrecked grandson wandering
barefooted in some distant part of the earth, took pity upon the poor
orphan, and gave him what little she could afford - and more - with
such kind and gentle words, and such tears of sympathy and compassion,
that they sank deeper into Oliver's soul, than all the sufferings
he had ever undergone.'' Oliver Twist, Chapter VIII}
\end{quote}

\section{Maximum number of chits}

Player characters can save the chits they accumulate during their
adventure as a good luck reserve for times of real trouble. However,
there is a limit to the number of chits they can accumulate. Chits
won by a character who has reached this limit are wasted and cannot
be used or shared.

\begin{center}
\label{sub:Maximum Number of Chits Table}
\par\end{center}

\begin{longtable}{cc}
\hline
\toprule 
Age & Can have up to\tabularnewline
\midrule
\hline
\endhead
\midrule 
9 & 22 chits\tabularnewline
\midrule 
10 & 20 chits\tabularnewline
\midrule 
11 & 18 chits\tabularnewline
\midrule 
12 & 16 chits\tabularnewline
\midrule 
13 & 14 chits\tabularnewline
\midrule 
14 & 12 chits\tabularnewline
\midrule 
15 or more & 10 chits\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}


\section{Sharing chits}

Players can transfer chits to other player characters. For every 3
chits you share, the other character receives 2. If you share 2 chits
the other character would receive 1 chit. As you can see, sharing
3 chits gets a better rate. This is quite a good number of chits to
share, so reserve them for an emergency.

Sharing chits does not qualify for either an act of kindness or heroic
generosity, so you do not earn chits by sharing them. However, you
can consider yourself a good friend, tap yourself on the back and
smile proudly.


\section{Losing chits}

There is a difference between spending and wasting chits. A player
can waste his chits for re-rolls that were not worth it or he can
save them for when they are sorely needed. However, there are actions
and situations that will cause you to lose chits. These are introduced
for game balance and to help players role play better and think deeper.

There are three kinds of situations that will eat your chits up. First
of all, losing at something you are \emph{good at} or in which you
have given significant effort; second, acting against the Newsies
Code%
\footnote{See chapter \vref{cha:The-Newsboy-Code}.%
} and third, significant emotional distress. Some of these situations
are detailed in the table below. As always, the game master should
use discretion and consider this table as a guide, not the Bible.

\noindent \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cc}
\toprule 
Event & Chits Lost\tabularnewline
\midrule
\midrule 
Fumbling at something you are \emph{good at} & 1\tabularnewline
\midrule 
Fumbling after using 1 or more chits & 1\tabularnewline
\midrule 
First time your character steals & 3\tabularnewline
\midrule 
First time your character begs & 1\tabularnewline
\midrule 
Loses at some competition & 1\tabularnewline
\midrule 
Cowardice, if friends are in danger & 2\tabularnewline
\midrule 
Going hungry, per day & 1 or 2\tabularnewline
\midrule 
E-grade clothes in cold weather & 1\tabularnewline
\midrule 
D or E-grade clothes in freezing weather & 2\tabularnewline
\midrule 
Homeless, per week & 1\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\par\end{center}
\begin{description}
\item [{Stealing:}] Caught or not, your character loses 3 chits the first
time he steals.
\item [{Begging:}] When your character has to beg for money from strangers
(the very first time), your character loses 1 chit for the humiliation.
\item [{Going~Hungry:}] Every night you go to bed without having been
able to eat at least one full meal, you lose 1 chit; 2 if the weather
is cold.
\item [{E-Grade~Clothes~in~Cold~Weather:}] E-grade clothes are not
warm enough to protect you in cold weather. For every full day that
you have to face wearing E-grade clothes in cold weather, you lose
1 chit%
\footnote{More rules about weather in Chapter \vref{cha:Optional}.%
}.
\item [{D~or~E-Grade~Clothes~in~Freezing~Weather:}] Freezing weather
is severe enough that only C-grade clothes or better can protect you.
For every full day that your character has to face wearing nothing
better than D or E-grade clothes in freezing weather, your character
loses 1 chit.\end{description}
\begin{quote}
You cannot lose more than 5 chits in any given season due to hunger,
foul weather or homelessness. The game master may choose to ignore
the loss of chits between adventures.
\end{quote}

\section{No chits? Big problem.}

Having no chits means more than just not being able to re-roll or
buy favors from the game master. Your character believes he's out
of luck and feeling deeply sad. Call it a depression if you like,
but I would not get that pretentious. Why is being so sad a problem?
Because until you get at least 1 chit (or somebody shares one with
you), every time you attempt an action that demands a dice roll you
have to first roll one normal die in the following table.

\begin{longtable}{cc}
\hline
\toprule 
Die (nd) & Result\tabularnewline
\midrule
\hline
\endhead
\midrule 
1 & ``It's no use trying.'' (Make no attempt.)\tabularnewline
\midrule 
2-3 & ``I'll just fail.'' (TN + 1)\tabularnewline
\midrule 
4-5 & No effect. (Roll normally.)\tabularnewline
\midrule 
6  & ``An angel smiles.'' (Gain 1 chit and roll normally.)\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}


\subsubsection*{Exceptions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item You don't roll on this table while in a serious fight or during an
emergency. Adrenaline and instincts won't let you die without a fight.
\item Non-player characters don't have chits and they won't use this table. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Explanation of results}
\begin{itemize}
\item ``I'll just fail.'' Your character is so convinced of being a failure
that he is unable to make a full effort. Raise the TN by 1; better
luck next time.
\item ``An angel smiles.'' Call it God's help, endorphins, or whatever
you like. Your character has just recovered from his sadness, as young
persons often do. You get 1 chit; use it with care.
\item ``It's no use trying.'' Instead of trying, your character blames
his bad luck on the world, his parents or his friends. He starts whining,
rolls himself up in ball or does anything but what he intended to
do. He can try again once he is over it, after five minutes has passed.
\item ``No effect.'' Just as it says; you roll your dice normally. \vfill{}

\chapter{Fights and chases\label{cha:Fights,-Chases-and}}

\noindent \lettrine{F}{}ights and chases are chaotic and dangerous.
One single shooting in the whole adventure could be deadly to all
the characters. Needless to say, \emph{Newsies \& Bootblacks} is not
a game about killing monsters and plundering their treasure, so combat
could well be limited to slingshots, water buckets and cream cakes. 

Sometimes there are no better alternatives. If you deal with nefarious
spies, mad scientists, or rabid cats, or you dodge a band of young
bullies, sooner or later you could end up in a fight. A bully would
probably limit himself to knock you down and steal your stuff, but
an evil wizard and his zombies might be less kind. Bottom line: even
if it's not essential to the stories, we need to address combat with
care. 

Bear in mind that \emph{Newsies \& Bootblacks} does not attempt to
mimic real life. Players are trying to simulate stories, comics and
films. As such, and in the name of good fun, I'd ask the adults to
remember the fun they had when they were 10 years old; when they made
their toys fight each other.


\section{Sequence }

To have some control in the chaos of combat, \emph{Newsies \& Bootblacks
}has a sequence of actions. Use it as a to-­do list for combat. You
first have to do something, then you do something else. I know that
it's a bit artificial to say you first shoot, move and then fight,
or that fire ``fights'' when it burns, but many games use a similar
structure and it works out quite nicely. So, let me introduce you
to the full sequence below: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Surprise%
\footnote{This step of the sequence occurs only when there is a chance of surprise.%
}
\item Initiative roll
\item Shooting / Throwing / Ranged attacks 
\item Movement / Reaction phase 
\item Close combat 
\item Checking for victory 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Surprise }

This phase of the sequence is optional. In most circumstances both
warring parties would be aware of each other, and in that case there
is no need to roll for surprise; go directly to Section 6.3 ``Initiative''.
Yet, when one group is ambushing another we need to see if they have
achieved their goals.


\subsection{The surprise roll}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The ambushers roll for Stealth, using the character with the \emph{worst}
odds. The game master may grant special modifiers if the terrain,
the weather or darkness are in favor of the ambushing party. The table
below includes a few examples.
\item Nobody can help in that roll.
\item The ambushed group rolls for Observation, using the character with
the \emph{best} odds. Again, nobody can help in that roll.
\item If the ambushed party rolls a lower number than the ambushing party,
they have been surprised.
\item If the ambushed party rolls an equal or higher number than the ambushing
party, they have not been surprised; continue with the normal sequence.
\end{enumerate}
\noindent \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cc}
\toprule 
Situation & Modifier\tabularnewline
\midrule
\midrule 
Night & +2\tabularnewline
\midrule 
Rain or worse & +1\tabularnewline
\midrule 
Total darkness & +3\tabularnewline
\midrule 
Main street & -3\tabularnewline
\midrule 
Heavy fog & +2\tabularnewline
\midrule 
Sewers & +3\tabularnewline
\midrule 
Sneaky alley & +1\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\par\end{center}


\subsection{Effects of surprise}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The successful ambushers choose how close they get to the ambushed
party.
\item The surprised characters cannot move, shoot or attack for the rest
of the turn.
\item The successful ambushers can act normally.
\item Proceed to Section 6.4 ``Shooting and Ranged Attacks'', as there
is no need to roll for initiative.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Initiative }
\begin{enumerate}
\item Every character rolls for Athletics.%
\footnote{If using a bicycle or vehicle use the appropriate skill to ride them.%
}
\item Characters act in sequence according to their totals.
\item In the event of a tie:

\begin{itemize}
\item Player characters act first, if still tied.
\item Younger characters act first, if still tied.
\item The character with the most chits acts first, if still tied.
\item Roll again until you break the tie.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Shooting, throwing and ranged attacks }
\begin{enumerate}
\item Attacks by shooting are resolved just like any other skill check,
using the appropriate skill. 
\item In \emph{Newsies \& Bootblacks} all weapons are considered to be in
range%
\footnote{You can always try to hit, no matter how far away the target is.%
}. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Target number}
\begin{enumerate}
\item For most weapons, the TN is 6 + 1 for every full 10 yards of distance. 
\item For short-range weapons, the TN is 6 + 1 for every five full yards
of distance. 
\item For extreme short-range weapons the TN is 4 + 1 for every two full
yards of distance. 
\item Add 1 if the target is crouching or taking cover under a table, behind
a low wall or something like that. 
\item Add 2 if the target is smaller than a head. (Or, if you can only see
the head of your target.)
\item Add 4 if you cannot see your target but it's still possible to hit
the target; lobbing a stone, for example.
\item The TN cannot get any higher than 18, nor any lower than 6.\end{enumerate}
\begin{quote}
Example: Pip wants to hit a can that is 30 yards away, using his slingshot.
The slingshot is a short-range weapon, so the TN for this roll is
6 + (30/5) + 2 = 6 + 6 + 2 = 14. Had he tried to do the same with
a huge rock, an extreme short-range weapon, the TN would have been
4 + (30/2) + 2 = 4 + 15 + 2 = 21; which is cut down to 18 (the maximum
TN as per point 7 above). Wish him luck.
\end{quote}

\subsection{Dodging ranged attacks}
\begin{enumerate}
\item All missile and thrown attacks can be dodged%
\footnote{Yes, this includes bullets and ninja stars.%
}, \emph{provided the character is aware of the attack and can see
his attacker. }
\item The target number to dodge an attack is the number the attacker rolled.
\item Double the target number if dodging a bullet.
\item Each attack can be attempted to dodge just once.
\item There is no limit to the number of different attacks a \emph{player
character} can attempt to dodge.
\item A non-player character can only attempt to dodge as many attacks as
the number of dice of his Agility attribute. (So a policeman with
an AGI score of 4 wd, can attempt to dodge up to 4 attacks per turn.)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Movement and reaction phase}

Every character, animal or vehicle in this game moves one pace per
turn at their normal speed. The trick lies in that some paces are
longer than others. For anybody younger than nine; one pace equals
two yards per turn; for nine to 11, that's three yards per turn; for
12 to 14 it's four yards per turn, while those 15 years of age and
older move at five yards per turn. The following table demonstrates
some examples. The game master may adapt those for anything not covered
here, such as giant apes or aliens from outer space. 

That explains your basic walking movement, but there could be times
when you want to go much faster. In those cases you have to roll on
Athletics, Riding or Vehicles. Your choice depends on whether you
are on your feet, riding a horse or using some modern vehicle. The
target number should be determined by the game master, taking into
account the state of the ground, the weather and any other appropriate
circumstances. If everything is normal the TN should be 10. 

After passing the test, the character doubles his pace%
\footnote{Or that of the vehicle he's using.%
}. Triple the pace if the character achieves a spectacular success.

However, if you fumble you only move half your pace and then suffer
a mishap. If you are running or riding a bicycle when you suffer the
mishap, you trip or fall to the ground, possibly getting a few bruises.
Inside a vehicle, both driver and passengers could suffer life-threatening
wounds%
\footnote{Details can be found in Section \vref{sec:Damage}.%
}.

\midrule 
Horse & 15 yards\tabularnewline
\midrule 
Heavy horse carriage & 10 yards\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\par\end{center}


\section{Close combat}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Every character can only attack once per turn%
\footnote{Except in very special cases, as determined by the game master.%
}.
\item A character who is facing an enemy at less than \emph{two yards} or
so, can attack in close combat.
\item The attacker rolls for the appropriate \emph{weapon,} skill, or Fisticuffs,
if fighting unarmed.
\item The attacker should add or subtract the appropriate modifiers that
the game master imposes on the roll, to provide for special circumstances.
A table with examples follows.
\item The defender rolls, using his Dodging skill.
\item If the defender rolls higher or equal to the attacker, the attack
has failed.
\item If the attacker rolls higher than the defender, the attack has been
successful and the defender will probably suffer some form of harm.

\section{Damage \label{sec:Damage}}

When your character gets hit, he will more than likely suffer some
damage and in some cases death (unless you use one of your handy chits).
Combat in this game ­as in real life, ­canbe quite deadly. Fortunately,
most often you will not be using real weapons. Honest traders do not
sell real weapons of any kind to children, and weapon possession ­while
lawful, ­is not common in New Paris City. Rarely, in most campaigns,
will you ever see a gun used in anger. If you do you'd better run
because those things kill fast. 


\subsection{The damage roll}
\begin{itemize}
\item Test your Health against the damage rank of the weapon that hit you.
\item The damage rank of unarmed attacks is equal to a roll of the attacker's
Strength dice (STR)%
\footnote{Pip's Strength is three weak dice, so when he hits an opponent he'll
roll three weak dice; the total being the damage rank of the attack.%
}.
\item The damage rank of most hand-to-hand weapons is equal to a roll of
the attacker's Strength dice plus some modifier.
\item The damage rank of most missile weapons is a fixed number.
\item The effects depend on the nature of the weapon and your roll.\end{itemize}
\begin{description}
\item [{Non-Lethal~Weapons:}] These are those weapons which cannot normally
kill an adult in a novel or story. In real life, it's perfectly possible
to kill somebody with a cane or by stoning them, but it is stories,
films and comics that we are trying to simulate; not real life. 

\begin{description}
\item [{Success:}] If your character has passed the Health check he is
uninjured. He was tough enough and there's nothing to worry about. 
\item [{Fail:}] If your character has failed the Health check you will
receive a bruise. Each bruise gives you a malus of ­ 1 for all your
actions. 

\begin{quote}
\emph{For example:} you are involved in a fight with a band of bullies.
They hit you seven times in the face (ouch!). That means you have
to test your Health seven times. You are lucky (or tough) enough to
pass five of these checks. But you failed two of these so you received
two bruises. Now you are at \emph{-}2, so every time you roll the
dice to check for a skill or attribute, you subtract 2 points to every
roll. If you later receive another bruise, you'll be at \emph{-}3
and you'll have to subtract 3 points to every roll, and so on. 
\end{quote}
\item [{Fumble:}] If you fumble the check you move down one step in the
damage scale. This is explained in Section 6.7.2. It means you go
from swell to hurt, from hurt to grave and from grave to dead. 
\end{description}
\item [{Toy~Weapons:}] Toys that cannot kill an adult%
\footnote{In real life silly accidents are always possible.%
}. In fact, most may only cause embarrassment. We are speaking of such
terrible instruments as cakes, splashing of water and such. 

\begin{description}
\item [{Success:}] If your character has passed the Health check he is
uninjured. He was tough enough and there's nothing to worry about. 
\item [{Fail:}] If your character has failed the Health check you will
receive a bruise. Each bruise gives you a malus of -1 for all your
actions. However, unlike the case of non-lethal weapons, all the \emph{damage}
that toy weapons cause is \emph{healed} right after the end of the
fight. Remember to record toy weapons damage separately.
\item [{Fumble:}] Your character is so embarrassed that he will not be
able to act for one turn, and may be either crying as a baby or shouting
ferocious, angry threats.
\item [{Toy~Weapons~vs~Lethal~Weapons:}] If any lethal or extremely
lethal weapon is used in the action, toy weapons cease to cause any
harm at all. When you see a shotgun nobody cares about being hit by
a cake. 
\end{description}
\item [{Lethal~Weapons:}] Weapons that can kill somebody in a story, though
most times the afflicted character survives. We are speaking of knives,
the teeth of a strong dog and very small pistols such as a derringer. 

\begin{description}
\item [{Spectacular~Success:}] Luckily, the attack was too weak and your
character is unharmed.
\item [{Success:}] If your character passes the Health check he is still
bruised and you receive a -\,1 bruise. 
\item [{Fail:}] If your character fails the Health check he moves down
one step in the damage scale that moves in succession from swell to
hurt to grave and finally, to dead%
\footnote{More details are found in section \ref{sub:TDamage-Scale.}. %
}. 
\item [{Fumble:}] If your character fumbles he will die unless you spend
a chit right away. 
\end{description}
\item [{Extremely~Lethal~Weapons:}] Weapons that can kill an adult in
one single attack, and often do so in stories. Examples include swords,
revolvers, rifles or large fires. You are advised to be very careful
when somebody uses them. 

\begin{description}
\item [{Spectacular~Success:}] Even with a spectacular success your character
receives one bruise. Consider it a scratch.
\item [{Success:}] If your character passes the Health check he moves up
one step in the damage scale.
\item [{Fail~or~Fumble:}] If your character fails or fumbles he will
die unless you spend a chit right away.

\subsubsection{Special weapons}

Some weapons are so special they cannot be easily included in a table.
Let me introduce you to the following:
\begin{description}
\item [{Cane-Sword:}] A sword in a cane. With just a turn of your wrist
on the head of the cane, you will have a sword on your hands.
\item [{Pepperbox~Pistol:}] The grandfather of the revolver. The pepperbox
pistol has several individually loaded barrels that rotate as the
trigger is pulled. Treat it as a revolver.
\item [{``My~Friend'':}] A knuckle-duster pepperbox combo. This odd
weapon is shaped so it can easily be held and used as a knuckle-duster.
\item [{Gaulois~Pistol:}] The Gaulois pistol looks like an elaborate cigar
case of A-grade, yet it's intended for self-defense at close range.
Use it as a revolver, but lower the range to extreme short.
\item [{Penknife~Pistol:}] A penknife and pistol combination. Treat it
as a derringer when shooting. If used in hand-to-hand combat, treat
it as a cane.
\item [{Walking-Stick~Gun:}] A carbine disguised as a stick. Use it as
a rifle, but lower the damage to 13.
\end{description}

\subsection{The damage scale\label{sub:TDamage-Scale.}}

The damage scale is an easy way to say how hurt a character is. Every
player starts at swell and during game time, they may be downgraded
to hurt. From hurt a player worsens to grave, which is a serious condition,
and then finally, dead. Each of these conditions have an effect on
what a character can do. An explanation of these follows. 
\begin{description}
\item [{Swell:}] Your character is perfectly healthy and you have nothing
to worry about. Bruises are kept from the damage scale, so no matter
how many bruises you get, you retain your swell status. You can be
swell and still be at -\,­5 bruises or worse. 
\item [{Hurt:}] Your character is suffering from a wound or sickness that
is serious enough to hinder your actions, but not to endanger your
life. You are at -\,­5 for all your actions (in addition to any bruises).
So, if you have -\,3 bruises, you are down to -\,­8. 
\item [{Grave:}] Your character is in real trouble. You are wounded and
at -\,­5 for all your actions plus any bruises, just as when you
are hurt. However, it hurts so much you need to roll for Health with
a TN of 10, just for standing up. Walking requires a TN of 12. Running
and other strenuous physical activities are next to impossible. 
\item [{Dead:}] If you don't spend a chit immediately your character is
quite dead. There is nothing your friends can do about it, except
to arrange for a decent burial. The game master might let you say
up to 25 last words. 
\end{description}

\subsection{Effects of damage on non-living objects}

For non-living objects, the game master should assign a fake Health
attribute. Bruised items will only need a paint job, suffering no
harm. Hurt items lose one level of quality. Grave items lose two levels
of quality. Dead items are considered destroyed for all functional
purposes.

If an item drops lower than E-grade, it is also destroyed.


\section{Checking for victory}

Once all the characters have had the opportunity to act, the turn
is over. Then the game master should check for victory if any of the
following conditions have been met.
\begin{itemize}
\item The non-player group (and only the non-player group) has been surprised
in this turn.
\item It's not a serious fight%
\footnote{Like in a cake throwing battle.%
} and the non-player group has suffered more bruises than the player
character group in this turn.
\item The non-player group has suffered more hurt (or worse) results than
the player character group in this turn.
\item The game master considers that the non-player group has little chance
to win.
\end{itemize}
To check for victory, the game master rolls three normal dice. The
usual TN is 11, but the game master can increase or decrease this
number according to the circumstances of the fight.
\begin{description}
\item [{Success:}] The non-player group keeps fighting another turn.
\item [{Fail:}] The non-player group will try to break off combat right
away, saving their belongings and helping the injured members of their
group, if any. If the players decide to run after them, uninjured
non-player characters will defend themselves if attacked; hurt or
worse non-player characters will surrender as soon as they are in
close combat range.
\item [{Fumble:}] The non-player group will run away immediately, as fast
as they are able, dropping whatever they are carrying and forsaking
any injured members of their group. If the players decide to run after
them, the non-player characters will surrender as soon as they are
in close combat range.
\end{description}

\section{\label{sec:Healing}Healing}
\begin{description}
\item [{Bruises:}] Healed after a good full night of rest.
\item [{Bruises~from~Toy~Weapons:}] These are healed immediately after
the fight is ended. (Write a small ``t'' on your character sheet
to tell these from regular bruises.)
\item [{Hurt~or~Grave:}] A hurt or grave character needs some form of
medical attention. The healer (doctor, nurse or amateur) should roll
for Healing with a TN of 11 if the character is hurt or 14 if he is
grave. This roll encompasses all the Healing attempts in any given
day and can only be tried once a day.

\begin{description}
\item [{Fumble:}] The character's condition worsens. Hurt worsens to grave
and grave worsens to dead (unless the character spends 1 chit).
\item [{Fail:}] Roll one die. On a roll of 1 the character's condition
worsens, as if the healer had fumbled. On a roll of 2 to 4 the character
remains hurt or grave. On a roll of 5 to 6, the character's condition
improves. Grave worsens to hurt and hurt recovers to swell, but with
five bruises that will heal normally after a good full night of rest.
\item [{Success:}] The character's condition improves. Grave improves to
hurt and hurt recovers to swell, but with five bruises that will heal
normally after a good full night of rest.
\item [{Exceptional~Success:}] The character's condition improves. Grave
recovers to swell, but with five bruises that will heal normally after
a good full night of rest; hurt recovers immediately.
\end{description}
\end{description}
If the character receives no medical attention, roll one die. On a
roll of 1 or 2 the character's condition worsens. On a roll of 3 to
5 the character remains hurt or grave. On a roll of 6, the character's
condition improves. Grave improves to hurt and hurt recovers to swell,
but with five bruises that will heal normally after a good full night
of rest.


\chapter{Rumors and follies\label{cha:Rumors-and-follies.}}

\lettrine{T}{}he streets of New Paris City are paved with rumors,
mysteries and urban legends. Many of them are completely false. Yet,
even the most uncanny could be true, or at least somewhat resemble
the truth. Some are linked to a location like the ghost children who
haunt the New Paris sewers, or a date ­such as the extraordinary opportunity
for jobs at Christmas. 

In Part 2, you will find a selection of rumors, most of them linked
to places or dates. Adventures and campaigns can include their special
rumors to add some variety to the game. Moreover, the game master
and the other players can suggest other rumors at any time, even in
the middle of a game, as explained in Section 7.3 ``Rumors''. 


\section{Rating rumors}

Rumors are rated with the standard grades from A to E, with A being
the most plausible and E the least likely to be true. ``Tomorrow
it's sales at Wesson \& Wesson General Store'' would probably be
a B-class rumor, while ``There is a goblin hidden at Wesson \& Wesson
General Store'' would certainly be an E-class rumor. A game master
can choose which of the rumors are true or not, based on his preferences
and the needs of the game, or he can roll three normal dice and consult
the following table. 

\begin{center}
\textbf{\large Rumors Table} 
\par\end{center}

\begin{center}
{\footnotesize (Roll three dice, add them)}
\par\end{center}{\footnotesize \par}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
\toprule 
Grade & Truth & Half-Truth & False\tabularnewline
\midrule
\midrule 
A & 9+ & 5 to 8 & 4 -\tabularnewline
\midrule 
B & 12+ & 7 to 11 & 6 -\tabularnewline
\midrule 
C & 14+ & 9 to 13 & 8 -\tabularnewline
\midrule 
D & 16+ & 12 to 15 & 11 -\tabularnewline
\midrule 
E & 18 & 12 to 17 & 13 -\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}\medskip{}

\par\end{center}

\begin{center}
12\,+, for example, means \textquotedbl{}12 or higher\textquotedbl{};
\par\end{center}

\begin{center}
5 to 8 means ``5, 6, 7 and 8''; 
\par\end{center}

\begin{center}
4 ­means \textquotedbl{}4 or less\textquotedbl{}.
\par\end{center}
\begin{description}
\item [{Truth:}] The rumor is true exactly as told, with perhaps some minor
difference that is necessary to adapt it to the adventure being played,
and the previous actions of the players. 
\item [{Half-Truth:}] At least one of the major elements of the story or
prophecy is false. For example: let's suppose a rumor says ``there
is a ghost dog that attacks newsies on sight every night at 2 a.m.
in some unnamed alley. A half-truth result could be interpreted that
the dog is not a ghost, it does not attack newsies, or that it is
a friendly ghost puppy.
\item [{False:}] The whole story is false, either because it never happened,
it did happen but has ceased, or because the real events are so divergent
from the truth they're of little consequence. For example: the goblin
at Weson \& Wesson General Store is nothing but a decorative statue.
\end{description}

\section{New rumors}

Both game masters and players can introduce new rumors at any time,
even in the middle of a game. In the case of the game master, he chooses
the grade of the rumor. Even if a player suggests a rumor, it would
be the game master who assigns its grade. The game master can veto
a rumor if it's just too wacky. 

When to choose or roll for rumors? Unless the specific rules from
an adventure tell you otherwise, the game master is free to choose
the time to roll for rumors. You could roll for rumors when preparing
the game, when the player characters first enter a location, when
the players defeat some enemy or just when you want to add a little
spice to the game. \medskip{}

\begin{quote}
You can also roll for rumors when you go to check a situation or event
in the game world for which there is no specific rule. For example:
suppose the characters are breaking and entering into some dusty cellar
and you'd like to know if there are any cops nearby. You could treat
the situation as the rumor; ``There are a couple of policemen within
hearing distance'' and grade it with a D. After rolling an 11 on
three dice you determine there is no immediate police trouble (or
help) for the player characters%
\footnote{There is no need to tell them, though!%
}.
\end{quote}
\medskip{}



\chapter{Character advancement\label{cha:Character-Advacement}}

\lettrine{P}{}layer characters advance (i.e., improve their scores)
on some special days, the most important of which is their birthdays.
It is one those days that the efforts of an adventuring campaign will
pay off.


\section{It's your birthday!}


\subsection{This is what you get}

Before you start an adventure, the game master should (at the very
least) tell the players the season in which the adventure begins.
If a character's birthday falls in that season (that's right, season,
not day),­the character immediately reaps the following benefits%
\footnote{These benefits are, of course, received just once a year.%
}: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Roll one normal die, you get that many chits.
\item One attribute point. 
\item One skill point, plus one skill point for every ``won'' adventure
since your last birthday. 
\item Obviously, age is raised one year. Tap yourself on the back; you are
a little older. 
\end{itemize}
Attribute points (AP) are used exactly as they were used in creation
rules, which are repeated here from Section 2.2.2. 
\begin{quote}
With those attribute points you can buy dice for your character's
attributes. Every weak die costs 1 AP, while a normal die costs two
APs.\emph{ }You can also upgrade a weak die to a normal die for 1
AP\emph{. Adult characters can have allocated up to six dice in any
single attribute. However, these are all non-player characters played
by the game master.}%
\footnote{As normal dice are not twice as powerful as weak dice, read a 6 as
if it were a 5. It is a good idea to buy weak dice until you have
four dice in any single attribute. If you still need to improve that
attribute upgrade those weak dice to normal dice.%
} \emph{Every attribute must have at least one die allocated to it}.

In case you are wondering, you can't buy swell or fool dice. Your
character's \emph{skills} can \emph{upgrade} your normal dice to swell
dice, or in some cases, \emph{downgrade} your weak dice to fool dice.
See Sections 1.2 and 3.2.1 for additional references.
\end{quote}

\subsubsection*{School}

Characters who don't attend a school of some sort regularly, cannot
raise their Education attribute on their birthday. 


\subsection{Spending attribute points}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Weak dice are worth 1 AP each. 
\item You can upgrade a weak die to a normal die for 1 AP. 
\item You can't buy swell or fool dice. Buy your dice and split them among
your attributes. 
\item Your character can't have more than four dice in any attribute. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Spending skill points}

Each skill point entitles you to one of the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Upgrade a skill that you are \emph{bad at} to \emph{OK at}.
\item Upgrade a skill that you are \emph{OK at} to \emph{good at}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Other effects of your birthday}
\begin{description}
\item [{Clothes:}] Your clothes no longer fit, as they are one size too
short. If you keep them, their quality will drop one level. A becomes
B, B becomes C, C becomes D, D becomes E and E just can't get any
worse.
\item [{Other~Equipment:}] It's not necessary to roll for other equipment;
it's too time-consuming for such little effect. But if you have the
time%
\footnote{Or, the game master wants to keep the players busy while he's checking
his notes.%
}, you can roll for any item your character has. On an odd result,
the quality of that item will drop one level.
\item [{Turning~15:}] On your 15th birthday your character will no longer
be considered a child. Revel in the glory of knowing that from now
on you can have up to six dice in any attribute. A more unfortunate
effect is that you can no longer stay at the Newsboy Lodge. You will
have to look for a home or room to rent, so you should plan well in
advance. Get an education and if possible, a good job, perhaps as
a journalist. Surely you've learned a bit about what the public wants
to read by now! 
\item [{Turning~17:}] \emph{Newsies \& Bootblacks} is a game about boys
and girls. Once you turn 17 your character becomes a non-player character
and it can only be played by the game master as he sees fit. Let him
go. Create another character and keep having fun. 
\end{description}

\section{Seasons\label{sec:Seasons}}

In \emph{Newsies \& Bootblacks} there is quite literally, an adventure
every season. Once the adventure is over the characters return to
their usual ordinary lives selling newspapers, cleaning boots, doing
errands, dodging bullies, studying, having fun and in general, trying
to live a swell life. Yet, even in those less glamorous times, there
are some great days to remember. Each of those special days grant
special benefits for the player character.

If those days happen while the characters are involved in an adventure
session, the game master should grant the benefits suggested in their
appropriate sections as soon as it makes sense within the game%
\footnote{\noindent If the character has been kidnapped by a mad wizard on Christmas,
they will probably not see any presents until they escape from the
criminal.%
}. 

If those days fall between adventures, the game master should grant
the benefits they provide before the start of the next game session.


\subsection{Spring}


\subsubsection*{April Fools' Day}

April Fools' Day is not a festivity celebrated by any self-respecting
gentleman in New Paris. Among kids however, it is a day of complete
mayhem and fun, though a few could get as the saying goes, more than
they bargained for.

Player characters who decide to participate in the festivities should
choose their risk level and roll one normal die in the following table.

\begin{center}
\medskip{}

\par\end{center}

\begin{center}
\textbf{\footnotesize April Fools' Risk and Roll Table }\\

\par\end{center}{\footnotesize \par}

\begin{longtable}{cccc}
\toprule 
{\small Roll 1 nd} & {\small Low Risk} & {\small Medium Risk} & {\small High Risk}\tabularnewline
\midrule
\midrule 
{\small 1} & {\small Lose 1 chit} & {\small Lose 2 chits} & {\small Lose 3 chits}\tabularnewline
\midrule
\midrule 
{\small 2} & {\small Find clothes\,(1)} & {\small Find a lead\,(4)} & {\small Find a contact\,(7)}\tabularnewline
\midrule
\midrule 
{\small 3} & {\small Bedraggled\,(2)} & {\small Bruised\,(5)} & {\small Hurt\,(5)}\tabularnewline

{\small 4} & {\small Find \$1} & {\small Find \$2} & {\small Found!\,(6)}\tabularnewline
\midrule
\midrule 
{\small 5} & {\small Luck swap\,(3)} & {\small Luck swap~(3)} & {\small Robbed\,(8)}\tabularnewline
\midrule
\midrule 
{\small 6} & {\small Earn 1 chit} & {\small Earn 2 chits} & {\small Earn 4 chits}\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}\medskip{}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Somehow, you ended up with a full clothes kit that some rich kid lost
during all the action. He is too ashamed to look for it and so, you
have acquired a B-grade clothes kit in your size.
\item Somebody should have told you not to trust \emph{new friends }on April
Fool's Day. Unfortunately, you were too naive and you and your clothes
are covered with a mass of eggs, paint and mud that will not be cleaned
easily. Lower your clothes rank one grade%
\footnote{A turns to B, B to C, C to D, D to E and E remains at E.%
} and get a haircut.
\item Luck swap: Choose another \emph{player character} at \emph{random}
and swap his chits with yours.
\item Somebody has told you something about a treasure. The game master
should give you a hint about a secret treasure or an important element
of the next adventure; but be aware that it could all be a good joke.
\item Hurt: Sometimes pranks go too far, and this is one of those instances.
You have been hurt as per the \emph{Fights and Chases} rules (see
Section 6.7 ``Damage''), and you are going to need some medical
assistance.
\item Found: You found some special items or \$5; the game master chooses.
\item Find a contact: Your pranks have been so much fun that you have impressed
somebody. Choose any neutral non-player character to be a good support
to you. Warning: if the non-player character reveals to be a secret
enemy he will just pretend to be your friend.
\item Robbed: You have lost all the money you didn't have in safe storage
(either at the Lodge or a Bank).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Summer}


\subsubsection*{July the 4th}

July the 4th is the only major summer festivity in New Paris. It is
considered both a national and local event, as New Paris was able,
like New Orleans in the south, to keep the British at bay. Many New
Paris citizens dress up as \emph{patriots }or\emph{ redcoats }and
present pantomimes and re-enactments of the combat. The ``ragged
pirates regatta'' is the heyday of the festivities with hundreds
of makeshift boats sailing -- or rather, struggling to stay afloat
-- from New Harbor to Royal Island, to commemorate a frustrated assault
of the Royal Marines. The traditional prize for the first group of
children is a pushcart load of sausages, donated by the local butchers.


\subparagraph*{Benefits}
\begin{itemize}
\item Roll one swell die, you get that many chits.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fall}


\subsubsection{Halloween}

Only children celebrate Halloween in New Paris. Even so, there are
strange events happening on this date. If Halloween arrives while
the characters are playing an adventure, game masters are entitled
to re-­roll once all rumors have failed checks of grades D and E.
There are no special benefits on Halloween, though.


\subparagraph*{Rumors }
\begin{itemize}
\item E: A team of recruiters from a school of wizardry in Scotland is looking
for suitable candidates.
\item C: A group of rich teenager pranksters is hiding in or near one of
the cemeteries of New Paris, ready to wreak havoc on unsuspecting
children.
\item E: Ghosts can take an almost human form in the cemeteries.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Thanksgiving}

Thanksgiving is not a major festivity in New Paris, especially among
the Royal Island gentry who consider it an ``English thing''. However,
the Newsboy Lodge holds a special dinner with a singing contest on
the Plus Ultra%
\footnote{Latin for ``beyond''.%
} park in West Gate that attracts donors and the general public.


\subparagraph*{Benefits}
\begin{itemize}
\item One chit.
\item Roll one weak die, you get that many chits if your character is \emph{good
at} Performance.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Winter}


\subsubsection{Christmas}

Christmas in New Paris is very special. Snow covers the streets. If
it has not snowed before, it starts to snow on the dawn of December
the 24th, and keeps snowing until the streets are covered in white.
Yet, all that snow will not hinder the merriment of the people from
New Paris who will no doubt, take to the streets to congratulate each
other and, of course, to buy the \emph{Christmas Special Edition}
of their favorite newspaper as if their lives depended on it. 


\subparagraph*{Each player character gets:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Three free chits.
\item One present from Santa%
\footnote{For example: oranges, candy, a cheap toy or musical instrument such
as a harmonica or perhaps some clothing.%
}. 
\item Extra money from selling the \emph{Christmas Special Edition}: \$1
+ 6 swell dice in cents.
\item Your character must spend at least 10\% of his money in presents for
friends; ­these can be other player characters.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph*{Rumors}
\begin{itemize}
\item E: The devil is chained this day. No crimes will be committed on Christmas
Day. 
\item E: Santa is searching for a good child or children to: 

\begin{itemize}
\item do something very special, or even fantastic; 
\item give him a magical present; or
\item to recruit a new ``elf\textquotedbl{}. 
\end{itemize}
\item C: The New Paris Children's Hospital is hiring ``elves\textquotedbl{}
to deliver presents to children who are hospitalized there. They pay
50 cents for just one evening of smiling. Good carol singers (those
who are \emph{good at} Performance) can be paid up to \$2. Those wearing
D-grade clothes or worse, need not apply. 
\item B: The New Paris and New York Telegraph company is looking for messengers
to work from December the 24th through to the 25th, paying 50 cents
for each eight hours. Ownership of bicycles is not required, though
the company will not be providing any.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{New Year's}

The general merriment of this day is clouded by the many gangsters
who take benefit of the crowds; pillaging and plundering the unsuspecting
merrymakers.


\subparagraph*{Benefits (Decide if your character spends New Year's night at the
Lodge.)}
\begin{itemize}
\item If your character spends the night at the Lodge, you earn 1 chit.
\item If your character takes to the streets at night roll one die.

\begin{itemize}
\item On a roll of 1 to 5 your character earns 4 chits.
\item On a roll of 6 your character is assaulted and robbed. You are hurt,
as per the damage rules. Your clothes are downgraded to E and you
lose all the money you didn't have in safe storage.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Mardi Gras }

Mardi Gras is one of the second-largest celebrations of the New Paris
calendar. From the grandest ballroom in Royal Island to the darkest
slums of Decree, people dress in costumes, dance, play music, sing
and play all kinds of pranks. It is common for friends to pretend
to kidnap the children of their friends and hold them in supposed
confinement for a sleepover. Parentless children, such as the heroes
of the game, are almost never ``kidnapped''. 


\subparagraph*{Each player character gets:}
\begin{itemize}
\item One chit. 
\item Extra money from selling the \emph{Mardi Gras Special Edition}: \$1
+ 6 dice in cents.
\end{itemize}

\subparagraph*{Rumor}
\begin{itemize}
\item E: Elves appear on this date to exchange their own children for humans
and everybody 13 or younger is eligible. 
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Optional rules\label{cha:Optional} }

\lettrine{T}{}his whole chapter is optional. The Game Master and
the players should agree which of these, if any, they want to employ
in their games. Generally speaking, they should not be used by novice
players, but they can be introduced gradually as the players become
more and more comfortable with the basic rules.


\section{Good-for-nothings}

There are heroes, and then there are cowards or people who are worthless
in a fight. The game master may want to classify these as Good-for-nothings
(GfNs).


\subsubsection*{Rules}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Non-player characters are the \emph{only} ones who can be classified
as Good-for-nothings\emph{.}
\item GfNs are defeated as soon as they are hit with a non-lethal, lethal
or extremely lethal weapon. The game master should consider they are
running away, have surrendered or are incapacitated, according to
the situation.
\item In a non-serious fight, such as a cream cake battle or a game, GfNs
are defeated as soon as they are hit; even if with a toy weapon.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Weather}

In \emph{Newsies \& Bootblacks} we define weather in terms of how
the characters feel its effects; not by Celsius or Fahrenheit degrees.
There is no thermometer in the Newsboy Lodge; most newsies don't understand
degrees anyway. The weather can be hot, warm, cool, cold or frozen,
as described below: 
\begin{description}
\item [{Hot:}] Usually good news for newsies, bootblacks and all kinds
of peddlers. Temperatures in New Paris are almost never too hot and
except for sweating, there is not much to worry about on most days.
The sun is shining, the clouds are little more than a decoration in
a perfectly blue sky, and kids have fun playing in and around the
fountains. However, hot weather sometimes brings strong winds and
or rain showers, which would pretty much ruin the day for selling.
Sickness is more common during hot weather, so mind where you buy
your food. 
\item [{Warm:}] This is the best possible weather for selling any kind
of wares on the streets. It could rain, which might spoil the day,
but not very intensely. 
\item [{Cool:}] Welcome to the most common day in New Paris. The temperature
is tolerable, but the sky is overcast and rain is almost constant.
Seniors get their coats and start complaining, though newsies can
still handle it, even if barefoot and wearing a threadbare shirt.
Fog could appear and mix with the smoke of chimneys, making it difficult
to see the end of the street; beware of who could be lurking.
\item [{Cold:}] The climate becomes uncomfortable. It's not only the temperature
itself, but the heavy rain, wind, and even snow that are often associated
with this weather. These are the days that give newsies with D or
E-grade clothes and especially those who are homeless, cause for concern.
Selling will usually drop in the streets, though it is still possible
to sell your wares in the cafeterias and public places.
\item [{Frozen:}] Extremely cold temperatures are exceptional in New Paris.
Winter weather is often accompanied by heavy blizzards that pretty
much paralyze the city. Sleeping outside during this kind of weather
could be fatal. 
\end{description}
The game master has considerable leeway to interpret these categories.
How warm is warm? That's up to you. How constant is the rain? Again,
use your good sense; ask yourself, ``Would it be good for the game?'',
``Would it be good for the story?'', ``Would it be fair to the
players?''. Let your answers to questions like these guide your thoughts. 

What about tornadoes, hurricanes and other truly exceptional events?
New Paris is not completely devoid of these, but these situations
could dominate the story so much they should only be introduced when
the adventure requires it. The game master may choose to ignore the
following table and assume the weather is warm in summer, cool in
spring and fall, and cold in winter. However, if the game master wants
to spice things up a bit he can either choose another weather condition,
or roll with the following table before the adventure begins. 

\noindent \begin{center}

\section{Poison\label{sec:Poison}}

In \emph{Newsies \& Bootblacks} there are four types of poison: red
or killing poison; blue or slumbering poison; green or paralyzing
poison and white or slaving poison. 


\subsection{Red poison}

Red poison is the most dangerous as it can easily kill a player character,
especially if he's already been injured. The victim should test his
Health attribute against a TN of 12%
\footnote{The game master can change this target number.%
}.
\begin{itemize}
\item On a spectacular success: No effect.
\item On a success: The character worsens one rank in the damage scale.
\item On a failure: The character's condition is downgraded to grave if
he was either swell or hurt. If he was previously in grave condition,
he dies immediately.
\item On a fumble: The character dies immediately, except if he spends one
chit, as usual.
\item You can use 1 or more chits to avoid this damage.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Blue poison}

Blue poison is the favorite of kidnappers as it makes the victim fall
into a deep slumber and it's generally safe. Spies or criminals who
want to avoid the complications of a murder often resort to this poison
to ``sleep'' a bank guard or a newsboy who was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

The victim should test his Health attribute against a TN of 13%
\footnote{The game master can change this target number.%
}.
\begin{itemize}
\item On a spectacular success: No effect.
\item On a success: The character needs all his willpower to remain awake.
He is under a malus of -\,3 for all his attribute and skill checks
for the next hour. This malus does not accumulate to the consequence
of bruises or a hurt or grave condition, as the blue poison acts as
a painkiller.
\item On a failure: The character falls asleep immediately, not waking until
after 1 nd hours.
\item On a fumble: The character falls asleep immediately. After an hour
or so, the victim's respiration will become irregular and it will
be evident that he needs medical attention. If the victim is not taken
to hospital in 24 hours, he will never wake up.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Green poison}

This poison is almost always used by certain living monsters and such
animals as the mythical giant spider that lives in the sewers under
Point South%
\footnote{See page \pageref{sub:Point-South}.%
}.

The victim should test his Health attribute against a TN of 14%
\footnote{The game master can change this target number%
}.
\begin{itemize}
\item On a spectacular success: No effect.
\item On a success: The character has trouble coordinating his movements;
he is under a malus of -\,5 for his Agility and Agility-related skills
for one hour.
\item On a failure: The character falls to the ground at once, unable to
move any muscle in his neck for one full day. He retains the use of
his senses and is still able to speak.
\item On a fumble: The character dies, at once.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{White poison}

This poison is a myth of dime novels; the game master \emph{may }treat
its existence as a D or E-class rumor.

The victim should test his Health attribute against a TN of 11%
\footnote{The game master can change this target number.%
}.
\begin{itemize}
\item On a spectacular success: No effect.
\item On a success: The afflicted character feels pain if he disobeys any
command. For each act of disobedience he's harmed as if he had suffered
one -\,1 bruise. The effect wears off in one hour.
\item On a failure: The afflicted character feels pain if he disobeys any
command. For each act of disobedience he's harmed as if he had suffered
one -\,1 bruise. The effect wears off in one day.
\item On a fumble: The character becomes a puppet and will not take any
conscious action unless commanded to do so. If commanded, the character
will do anything unless they understand it involves killing or harming
somebody, even themselves. The effect wears off in one day.
\end{itemize}

\section{Selling\label{sec:Selling}}

\emph{Newsies \& Bootblacks} is not a game about selling newspapers,
it's a game about adventure. You might assume the player characters
make their daily sales, save a bit of money, pay their expenses and
waste the remainder on candy or a new baseball. However, if the adventure
requires it, or they are almost bankrupt, the game master might want
to investigate their sales records.


\subsection*{Rules}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Every character should check their Sweet Talk skill once for each
hour devoted to selling.
\item The TN is 8 + the newspaper unit price in cents%
\footnote{See Section \vref{sec:Newspapers}.%
}.
\item Add or subtract the following modifiers to the dice roll.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Area: +\,2 if selling in a good area for that particular newspaper;
-\,2 if the paper sells poorly in that area.
\item Weather: +\,2 hot, -\,2 cold, -\,4 frozen. 
\item Clothes: +\,2 A-grade, +\,1 B-grade, -\,1 D-grade, -\,2 E-grade.%
\footnote{Double the penalty if selling a fancy newspaper.%
}
\item \emph{Extra edition}: +\,1
\item Time of day: +\,1 from 7 to 9 a.m., -\,1 from 12 a.m. onwards, +\,1
from 3 to 4 p.m. (evening edition), -\,12 for yesterday's edition.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Results}
\begin{itemize}
\item On a fumble, the player character does not sell a single newspaper.
\item On a failure, the player character sells 1 nd worth of newspapers.
\item On a success, the player character sells 3~sd%
\footnote{Swell dice, ignore any result lower than 3.%
} + 6 newspapers.
\item On a spectacular success, the player character sells 4~sd%
\footnote{Swell dice, ignore any result lower than 3.%
} + 12 newspapers.
\end{itemize}

\section{Wages}

If the player character receives any wages for his job, let him roll
three dice every week, with the result being the number of cents he
is able to save after he has been paid. Characters younger than 12
should roll weak dice, 12 and 13 years old roll normal dice, while
those 14 and older should roll swell dice.


\section{Optional skills}
\begin{description}
\item [{Riding~Horses~(AGI),~Riding~Bicycles(AGI):}] Horses, mules
and ponies are a common method of transportation, yet it is unlikely
that a newsboy or bootblack would ever own, much less keep a horse
of his own. Horses and other mounts require stable space, attention
and grain. However, you may want to separate this from Riding Bicycles
if the game moves to the great outdoors.
\item [{Inventions~(EDU):}] Add this skill to the set if you want to add
a bit of steampunk to the game. This skill is powerful enough to need
very special rules.\end{description}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Everybody begins being \emph{bad at} Inventions. So 1 AP will rise
that to being \emph{OK at} Inventions; 2 AP will be needed to be \emph{good
at} Inventions.
\item Nobody can be \emph{good at} or \emph{OK at} Inventions unless he
isn't \emph{good at} Academics.
\item To make a new invention you need a small room for your laboratory,
some materials and \emph{at least} one week of concentrated work for
a simple invention. These rules are very generous!
\item Every \emph{attempt} to make a new invention costs 1~fd~of~chits,
without regard for the outcome.
\item The game master should assign a TN of 13 for the finished prototype
of a very simple invention. On a spectacular success the prototype
is of D-quality; on a success the prototype is of E-quality and quite
risky to use. So, don't take your Josephine to your flying machine
unless it has undergone extensive trials. 
\item Characters who are \emph{OK at }or \emph{good at} either Inventions
or Mechanics, can \emph{help}. But \emph{only} those who are \emph{good
at} Inventions can start a new invention.
\item New technologies must be invented separately because a new invention
can only incorporate one new technology at a time. If you desperately
need a deep diving submarine with a ray gun, you'll need to invent
your submarine and your ray gun separately.
\end{enumerate}

\section{\label{sec:Sickness}Sickness}

In \emph{Newsies \& Bootblacks} there are five classes of sickness,
rated from A to E according to the condition of the character who
suffers from them.


\subsection{Not so well: A-grade (no hospitalization required) }


\subsubsection*{Effects}
\begin{itemize}
\item Weakness -\,1 malus. 
\item Sneezing and coughing.
\item May use the restroom often. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Healing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Heals in one day without need for hospitalization or rolling for Health.
\item If the patient spends time outside without proper clothing (C-grade
or worse) in cold or freezing weather, roll to check for Health with
a TN of at least 10. One fumble and your condition worsens; you are
downgraded to a B-grade sickness. On a failure your condition isn't
modified.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{A bit sick: B-grade}


\subsubsection*{Effects}
\begin{itemize}
\item Weakness -\,2 malus.
\item Coughing, sweating and low fever.
\item May use the restroom very often.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Healing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Heals in one week, without need for hospitalization or rolling for
Health.
\item If the patient spends time outside without proper clothing (C-grade
or worse) in cold or freezing weather, check for Health with a TN
of at least 10. One fumble and your condition worsens; you are downgraded
to a C-grade sickness. On a failure your condition isn't modified.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sick: C-grade }


\subsubsection*{Effects}
\begin{itemize}
\item Coughing, sweating, moderate fever and pain.
\item May use the restroom very often.
\item The patient should stay in bed.
\item Weakness -\,3 malus.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Healing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Lasts one week.
\item After one week of sickness, check for Health (or the doctor's Healing
skill) against a TN of at least 12 (14 if the patient has spent significant
time out of bed). One fumble and your condition worsens; you are downgraded
to a D-grade sickness. On a failure your condition isn't modified,
and on a success your condition improves to a B-grade sickness. On
a spectacular success you are fully healed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Really sick: D-grade}


\subsubsection*{Effects}
\begin{itemize}
\item Coughing, sweating, high fever and pain.
\item May use the restroom very often.
\item The patient should stay in bed.
\item Fatigue -\,5 malus.
\item Can walk with help for a short distance. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Healing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Lasts one week.
\item After one week of sickness, check for Health (or the doctor's Healing
skill) against a TN of at least 13 (15 if the patient has spent significant
time out of bed). One fumble and your condition worsens; you die (unless
you spend a chit). On a failure your condition isn't modified, and
on a success your condition improves to a C-grade sickness. On a spectacular
success your condition improves to an A-grade sickness.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Gravely sick: E-grade }


\subsubsection*{Effects}
\begin{itemize}
\item Coughing, sweating, high fever and pain.
\item The patient must stay in bed.
\item Fatigue -\,7 malus.
\item Cannot walk or attempt any physical action at all.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Healing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Lasts two weeks.
\item After two weeks of sickness, check for Health (or the doctor's Healing
skill) against a TN of at least 13 (15 if the patient has spent significant
time out of bed). One fumble and your condition worsens; you die (unless
you spend a chit). On a failure your condition isn't modified, and
on a success your condition improves to a D-grade sickness. On a spectacular
success your condition improves to a C-grade sickness.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Medication}

Medication of this era could be worse than the sickness itself, having
been more often directed to alleviate the symptoms rather than assist
with healing. Sometimes all you need is to alleviate the symptoms
until the body can heal itself. So, they can still be beneficial.
\begin{itemize}
\item Proper use of medication adds +\,2 to Health and Healing rolls.
\item Only a doctor or nurse (non-player character) can designate the appropriate
medication for a particular sickness. If not prescribed by a doctor
or nurse, roll one fool die; the result being the malus you add to
the roll.\end{itemize}
\begin{quote}
For example: some well-meaning friend notices you are ill and gives
you a few pills she'd kept from the last time she was sick. Normally
they would add 2 to your Health roll, but as this medication has not
been prescribed by a doctor, you have to roll a fool die. You roll
a 3. So, you still add your +\,2 bonus, but you have to subtract
-\,3 malus for a total of -\,1. Better see a doctor next time.\end{quote}
\begin{itemize}
\item Rare sickness requires rare medication. The game master should assume
every sickness is of the common kind (even if A-grade) except when
the story requires a rare sickness. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Magic}

Magic is not supposed to exist in the world of \emph{Newsies \& Bootblacks}.
Respectable persons consider it nothing but superstitions and fairy
tales, and those who speak about magic, mesmerism or what have you
are nothing but obscurantists who impede human progress. The game
master might consider the mere existence of magic as a D to E-class
rumor. However, its effects are important enough not to leave this
decision to a dice roll. One good compromise could be to consider
magic as a mere fantasy unless the adventure played includes it.

Player characters should not be allowed to use magic except in very
specific circumstances directly related to an adventure. That limitation
should be enforced seamlessly to not look arbitrary and unfair. For
example, the game master could allow players a spell to fight off
vampires on a new moon. As vampires do not appear in normal life,
this spell could only be used in adventures. Alternatively, the spell
could demand such a hefty price, that the player characters would
only use it in extreme circumstances.


\subsection{Types of magic}

Powers can either be labelled as Blessings or Curses. Blessings are
ordained by God (or some good-natured source) while Curses are the
province of evil. Generally speaking, only saintly characters (player
or non-player) can cast Blessings. Curses, on the other hand, are
offered by evil to anybody it woos, often as an attempt to snare them
into leading them away from God (or the good source).

Powers (both Blessings and Curses) can be either subtle, normal or
powerful. Subtle powers are those that produce effects that could
have a non-magical source.


\subsection{Elements of magic}

Magic in \emph{Newsies \& Bootblacks} is described in terms of effects\emph{,
}limitations, skill and price. 


\subsubsection{Effects}

This refers to the desired outcome of the powers and can be anything
the game master can imagine.


\subsubsection{Limitations to powers}

In \emph{Newsies \& Bootblacks}, all powers suffer limitations of
both time and place. Most powers can only be used in the 13 days surrounding
Halloween (Curses) or Christmas (Blessings) and/or in specific locations
such as a haunted house or a forest. Powers should be tailored to
specific characters and the story, but every game master is free to
create new powers and limitations, as long as it provides a fair experience
to the players.

Some powers can only be cast a certain number of times per day, week,
month or season, even if the magic user can cast spells more often;
see the following subsection..


\subsubsection{Limitations to magic users}

A magic user can only cast a certain number of spells per day, week,
month or season. The precise number and rate is for the game master
to decide. Generally speaking, however, an apprentice magic user should
not be allowed to cast more than three curses per week, while a veteran
magic user should be able to cast up to six a day.

No magic user, by the way, should be allowed to cast more than 13
spells a day.


\subsubsection{Skill}

Magic is a skill linked to the Education attribute. All characters
are \emph{bad~at} Magic, and hence, utterly unable to cast any Blessings
or Curses. Player characters cannot learn Magic except by direct permission
of the game master, normally within an adventure. 

To cast a subtle spell demands a TN of 13. Normal spells require a
TN of 15. A powerful spell requires a TN of 17. In any case, characters
who are \emph{bad~at} Magic \emph{cannot} attempt to cast any magic
spell at all.


\subsubsection{Price}

Casting curses in \emph{Newsies \& Bootblacks} is a disruption of
the natural power and considered evil. Therefore, nature demands a
price on magic users. Price is always unknown to the magic user until
he suffers it. This price is often deferred in time, but sooner or
later, in a time unknown to the magic user, it shall have to be paid.
The table below is just an example. Game masters are encouraged to
build their own table.

Demons and such are paying with an eternity of suffering and hence,
do not have to pay any special price for casting powers.
\begin{itemize}
\item Blessings do not come with a price, but the magic user must spend
1 chit for each one. Non-player characters may have chits assigned
for this purpose only.
\end{itemize}

\end{longtable}
\begin{itemize}
\item Roll two dice. Add 3 to the dice roll if a fumble, subtract 3 if a
spectacular success.
\item ``nd'' refers to normal dice
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Explanations}
\begin{itemize}
\item Scared: Paralyzed by fear the user can't act until the next turn.
\item Lose something: The game master chooses one item for the character
to lose.
\item Unlucky: Re-roll all dice that favor the magic user.
\item One year older: Adjust age. The game master can adjust the magic user
stats.
\item Sick: Follow the rules referenced in brackets.
\item Slumber: The character falls into a deep slumber, to awake only 1
nd year later, or if kissed by someone of pure heart.
\item Loss of memory: The magic user becomes \emph{bad at} a randomly chosen
skill.
\item Monster: A monster appears bent to kill the user.
\item Death: The magic user is dead forever.
\item Fate worse than death: You would not want me to tell you about that,
would you?
\item Remember that Blessings are granted by God (or angels, or the Mystery)
and hence do not come with a price, except if the blessing is used
to commit an evil action.
\end{itemize}
The following Curses and Blessing lists are merely examples. The game
master may choose to use any or none of these and/or include any from
his own imagination.


\subsection{Some Curses}

These have been taken from the primer and modified to fit these rules.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Avarice\emph{.} (Normal) Gold nuggets will fall from the ceiling.
Those who fail to avoid them (Dodge TN of 9) will suffer bruises for
a -1 malus. This malus will not heal until after a good night of rest.
This curse can be placed three times per day.
\item Blindness\emph{. }(Normal) The victim can't see for one turn. Actions
that are dependent on sight will be at -10.
\item Despair\emph{.} (Subtle) The victim will begin to feel incredibly
sad, bursting into tears (lose 1 nd chit points).
\item Fear\emph{.} (Subtle) The victim is engulfed by terror. All actions
that require bravery will be at -3. 
\item Forsaken\emph{.} (Powerful) The victim is forgotten by everybody who
is not with him at the time of the curse. The magic user can only
place this curse once per season; though it will remain for life unless
they are defeated.
\item Gates to hell\emph{. }(Powerful) A door will open in the middle of
the room. Through it, the players will be able to see hell and its
thousands of demons. The demons can't enter to earth, but if anybody
steps into this spot willingly or unwillingly, there's no way back.
\item Nettle\emph{.} (Normal) The room will be \emph{instantly} covered
with nettles, blocking the way. The nettles will wither and die within
three turns. This curse can be placed three times per day.
\item Rag doll\emph{.} (Powerful) The afflicted character is paralyzed from
the neck down. This curse lasts until somebody does something kind
for the afflicted person. The witch can only use this curse once per
season.
\item Sick\emph{.} (Normal) The victim will burst out in a sudden fever,
and suffer pain and dizziness. All his actions are at -5.
\item Sloth\emph{.} (Subtle) The afflicted player will fall into a slumber,
not being able to act.
\item Triumph of the will\emph{.} (Powerful) The victim will freeze in place
until somebody commands him to do something. He'll then proceed to
complete the task assigned to the best of his ability. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Some Blessings}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Bless. The blessed player character receives 1 fd worth of chits.
The blessed player character cannot be the magic user.
\item Lay-of-hands. The blessed character is healed from any sickness, poison
or harm, recovering fully and instantly.
\item Message. The magic user may send any message to anybody in the world,
which they will experience in their dreams.
\item Counsel. This blessing can only be cast on non-player characters who
are not the main antagonists of the story. The magic user must be
able to communicate with the affected character by any means. This
cannot be used in a fight. The magic user must roll for Charisma,
with a TN of 9 for a young pickpocket, or 18 for a hardened criminal.
If the magic user succeeds, the affected character would decide to
stop doing wrong, while on a spectacular success the affected character
decides to become a saint.
\item Protection. During one turn nothing bad can happen to the magic user
or any of his friends.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Frauds}

Frauds regarding the supernatural should be at least as common as
real blessings or curses in a game of \emph{Newsies \& Bootblacks}. 


\section{Crimes, justice and punishment}


\subsection{Crimes\label{sec:Crimes}}

I do not expect any hero to commit a crime. Yet it is not impossible
for them to go falsely accused. In most games this chapter will never
be implemented, so feel free to skim through it, paying closer attention
to E crimes; you never know when you might go overboard in a prank.
While New Paris Criminal Law is as complex as any of the other states,
\emph{Newsies} simplifies the crimes in the usual five grades from
A to E. Each grade has a corresponding level of sentence. 
\begin{description}
\item [{E-grade~crimes}] are the only misdemeanors you can get away with.
The consequences could be no greater than a talk from the cop%
\footnote{You lose 1 chit for the stress.%
} or having to fix the mess you made. E-grade crimes involve using
offensive words in a polite setting, spitting, breaking a window while
playing baseball, shortchanging someone, playing too rough, etc. However,
don't get too happy committing E-grade crimes; you'll lose friends
fast, people will end up thinking you are better to be left alone.
The cops could become angry enough to judge you as if you have committed
a D-grade crime. The beat cop judges E-grade crimes on the spot. There's
no procedure for trial; just make sure you answer his questions. 
\item [{D-grade~crimes}] are both petty and non-­violent. Examples include
shoplifting, pickpocketing a few cents, minor scams and insulting
an agent of law, which does include cops. A newsboy under arrest would
be escorted, most often unshackled, to the Precinct Constabulary House
Jail. After a summary trial, the culprit would be sentenced to pay
a small fine of up to \$5, spend one to 15 days in jail or perform
up to 30 days of reformation work, which usually means cleaning the
sewers or some other dirty job. The game master can get creative with
this. Repeat offenders would be sent to a reform school for an indefinite,
often short period of time.
\item [{C-grade~crimes}] are either petty and violent, or non-violent
and not so petty. In most cases, a boy condemned for such a crime
would be sent to a reform school for at least one full season and
up to four years. Through exceptional behavior while on the program,
the sentence may be shortened and the newsie put on parole after serving
at least the first quarter of the sentence.
\end{description}
B and A-grade crimes are actions that demand a serious response by
the authorities, with the culprit spending many years in prison or
worse. However, it is highly against the spirit of the game for a
player character to commit those actions.


\subsection{Police forces}

New Paris City has two major arms of defense against crime and misdemeanor.
First, is the New Paris Constabulary, a professional police force
that is largely visible in Royal Island, both harbors, West Gate and
Concordia and almost completely absent from Decree and sparse in the
Outer and Inner Expanses. Its methods are primitive at best, with
only a small number of detectives trained in methods of investigation.
These are only available for the most important crimes. However, the
vast majority of the Constabulary Officers are honest and fair enough
to recognize when they are making a mistake.

Each precinct offers a Constabulary House complete with sleeping facilities
for the officers, jail and a small hearing room for short trials of
minor crimes.%
\footnote{D or rarely E-grade crimes.%
} 

The second arm of defense in New Paris City is the Night Watch, a
volunteer police force, largely present in the Expanses and Concordia.
Its members are mostly volunteers, some of which are retirees from
the Constabulary or any branch of the armed forces. Their members
can legally arrest but only as an immediate measure, taking the suspect
right away to the Constabulary or a local court. The Night Watchers
are much more likely to use their guns in a stressful situation, but
again, most of them are honest and upright citizens trying to do a
job for which they are not always qualified for or fit to carry out.


\subsection{Punishment}


\subsubsection{The reform schools}

As the New Paris main response to juvenile crime, the reform schools
combine strict discipline, humiliation, token schooling and long hours
of labor to try and turn ``delinquents, vagrants, beggars, ruffians
and pickpockets into honest citizens''\emph{. }Recreation is limited
to one hour on work days and Sunday evenings, and is often limited
to an empty playground surrounded by high walls and armed guards.
Material conditions, however, are generally acceptable, as the reform
schools are not older than 10 years.

Children convicted for C-grade crimes are eligible for parole on the
last day of each month. Children convicted for D-grade crimes can
be freed at any time by the reform school principal. 


\subsubsection{Alternatives}

First offenders of C or D-grade crimes who aren't considered hardened
enough, can be placed under the authority of a guardian who usually
ends up enforcing some form of indentured servitude. Exceptions include
Professor Regenstein, a soft-hearted and wealthy philosopher, and
Rachel Borowitz a mystery writer, and some say%
\footnote{D-class rumor%
}, supernatural detective.

This placement lasts for one season, though in a few cases it can
turn into fostering.

\part{The World}


\chapter{The world and New Paris City}

\lettrine{T}{}he world of \emph{Newsies}, a role-playing game, is
in many regards, identical to that of the real Earth on the turn of
the XIX to the XXth century. The game master can start his game in
any year from 1890 to 1910, not bothering with exact dates. There
are some differences, the more obvious being geography: the state
and city of New Paris, located on the East Coast, somewhere south
of New York and north of New Jersey. Of course that means the geography
of the American East Coast is slightly changed to make space for it. 

A second difference is that the American Civil War was more bloody
than historically known, which had a devastating impact on American
political thought. That has led to the rise of two new parties: the
Centralist Party who desires to put an end to the states and reinforce
the powers of the president, and the Utopist Party who is displacing
the Socialists as the leaders of a revolution. Meanwhile, the Republican
and Democrat Parties hold the upper hand in the elections, though
that could change at the first economic recession. 

\emph{Newsies \& Bootblacks} uses the real world as inspiration and
a framework on which to weave adventures, not as a defined setting.
Therefore, the game master is free to change both the geography and
the history of the world as he or she sees fit. That said, it is recommended
to retouch history rather than making a complete overhaul. In other
words, add islands and some minor eastern European kingdom, or make
Napoleon win the Battle of Waterloo. But think twice before adding
continents or an eternal Roman Empire.


\section{History }


\subsection{In which year are we?}

We call the year in which the player characters begin their adventures
as the first~year. If the campaign continues long enough the following
years would be called, in succession, second, third, fourth and so
on. However, the game~master if he so chooses, can use any year from
1890 to 1910, just before World War 1. 

I feel there is no need to turn this game into a history book. These
days the Internet is loaded with information and reference materials.
A search for ``Victorian'', ``Edwardian'' or ``Belle Époque''
should give you more than enough information to inspire any game.


\subsection{History as rumors}

I suggest treating history as a rumor. You may assume that any unchallenged,
widely known fact of history is, for the purposes of this game, an
A-class rumor. The more obscure, less likely and less known a fact
of history is, the lower its grade.
\begin{description}
\item [{For~example:}] The name of the President of the United States
of America at any given date would be an A-class rumor. The fact that
Empress Sisi of Austria did love her husband, the emperor, could be
treated as a B or C-class rumor. Pondering which nation was really
the first to invent the submarine (or most inventions) could be treated
as a C-class rumor, for these were widely debated issues. Whether
or not the British used pork fat in their ammunition could be treated
as a D-class rumor.
\end{description}
The fun lies in the idea that any player can ask to challenge a fact
from the history of the real world as if it were a rumor; but only
the first time it's introduced%
\footnote{So, if you have already determined that the Wright brothers did invent
their planes, you cannot later challenge that fact in case you'd like
your character to be the inventor.%
}. 


\chapter{\label{cha:The-Newsboy-Lodge}The Newsboy Lodge}


\section{Welcome to the Lodge}

Somewhere in the Inner Expanses, near Newspaper's Row, you will find
the Newsboy Lodge. This is where most newsies who live on their own
sleep, eat and study. There are many reasons to go there in a newsboy's
own words\ldots{}
\begin{quote}
First, it is cheap because the New Paris Society for Children (NPSC)
pays most expenses. They are a group of kind old ladies and a few
young men with birds in their heads. But don't worry, you won't see
them very often. Yeah, you still have to pay, but it's much cheaper
than anywhere else, and you get a clean bed to sleep in. 

Second, there are rules. Yeah rules. If somebody steals from you,
is a bully or gets nasty, they will be asked to leave. The wardens
and the rest of us newsies will see to that. Sure, rules can get stupid
at times, but it's better than waking up to see somebody snatching
away your boots. 

Third, if you pay a bit more, you can have dinner and breakfast. Lunch?
You care for that all by yourself. It won't taste like your mom's
but that's OK. Well, you won't really know how well it tastes. After
a honest morning, you'll just gulp it down. 

Fourth, there is a school. And you only have to attend if you want
to. But it's better if you do because you'll get an education and
be able to find a job or work at a trade. You will have to bring your
own pencils and other supplies, but if you ask nicely, they'll let
you borrow supplies. You have to pay for the teachers. 

Fifth, you get a locker so you can keep your important stuff safe.
It ain't a warehouse, so be smart with what you keep. They'll also
keep your money, but you don't want to put it in your locker; it's
not like it's a safe, you know. Speak with the clerk and he'll note
it down in a book and put it in a safe or take it to the bank. When
you want your money, just go to the office and sign a paper; it's
that simple. The clerk does not ask any questions, most times. 

Sixth, what better place to get along with many other newsies who
can help you? 
\end{quote}

\subsubsection*{Prices at the Newsboy Lodge per week }
\begin{itemize}
\item Stay (bed \& breakfast) -- D 
\item Stay (full board) -- C
\item Dinner only -- D
\item School -- D 
\item Locker -- E (free for residents) 
\item Money deposit (free, residents only) 
\item Loans. The Newsboy Lodge can loan small quantities of money to the
residents without interest. 
\end{itemize}

\section{What's in the Lodge?}

In most circumstances, there is not much reason to describe the Newsboy
Lodge in detail, as it is a place of rest and a meeting place, not
much unlike an inn from the fantasy literature and games. The game
master has full liberty to tailor the Lodge to the needs of his campaign.
However, there are a few guidelines that the author of this game considers
reasonable to keep the flavor of the setting.


\subsection{Minimum rooms}

At least every Newsboy Lodge should have:
\begin{description}
\item [{Dorms.}] At least one room per gender filled with double beds and
little privacy. Usually there would be no other furniture with the
possible exception of some shared wardrobes or personal lockers.
\item [{A~kitchen.}] Completely forbidden to the users, this should be
a fairly large kitchen with all the means to cater for the residents
and other children (newsboys or not) who come to dine. Breakfast is
served to residents only. Lunch is provided just for the sick.
\item [{A~common~room.}] The common room can be large, encompassing a
full level of the Lodge or a number of smaller common rooms. These
rooms would be divided by activities, gender or age, according to
the need of the adventure the game master is foreseeing%
\footnote{Or his wishes.%
}. In any case, it should contain a library, some comfortable but old
armchairs and sofas, a chimney, a pool and tables on which to play
games or read.
\item [{A~dining~room.}] A large room with tables, chairs and a few cabinets
for the cutlery and saucers. It should be large enough to accommodate
all residents and a few more in no more than two shifts.
\item [{Two~bedrooms.}] These are for the wardens and one shared bedroom
for the janitors and other live-in workers, segregated by gender.
\item [{An~office.}] This is for administrative purposes. It should have
a small safe where newsboys can deposit their money. This is taken
daily to a common bank account, reserving a small fraction to pay
for minor expenses and to cater to the demands of the residents.
\item [{A~school~room.}] This area is equipped with cabinets and lockers
so the newsboys can store their school stuff safely.
\item [{Bath~and~restroom.}] At least one of each category, obviously
of the community kind, plus two staff toilets.
\item [{Infirmary.}] With one bed for every 20 residents or so, plus a
small room for the nurse in case she or he has to stay at night.
\end{description}

\subsection{Lodge personnel}

The Newsboy Lodge is directed by a commission of trustees but these
only visit the Lodge once per season. They make sure that the money
invested by the New Paris Society for Children is well spent. At the
head of the Lodge is the Warden who oversees other workers, a clerk
or clerks (sometimes residents) help him with the paperwork. A janitor
helps to maintain the premises and do a host of manual chores. There
are at least three ``sisters'', one of whom lives in the premises.
While the residents are largely independent, the sisters provide some
counseling, teach daily life skills and ensure rules are respected.
The kitchen is staffed by two professional cooks who are assisted
by four or five residents. Teachers and other volunteers help in the
various programs of the Lodge.


\section{The Lodge Timetable}

Again, a mere suggestion, though I hope this timetable can be useful
to game masters.

\medskip{}


\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\toprule 
Time & Weekdays & Sundays\tabularnewline
\midrule
\midrule 
4:00 & Wake up, hygiene & .\tabularnewline
\midrule 
4:30 & Breakfast & 7:00 Wake up, hygiene\tabularnewline
\midrule 
6:30 & Lodge closed & 8:00 Breakfast\tabularnewline
\midrule 
13:00 & Lodge open - school & Lunch\tabularnewline
\midrule 
16:00 & School or A.L%
\footnote{\emph{Ad Libitum; basically you can read, study, play, chat with friends
or just stay in the common room.}%
}. & Cleaning\tabularnewline
\midrule 
17:00 & School or free time & Recreation\tabularnewline
\midrule 
19:00 & Dinner & Dinner\tabularnewline
\midrule 
21:00 & Lights out & Lights out\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}\medskip{}

\par\end{center}

As you can see, the residents wake up quite early so they can buy
newspapers early. Most newsies eat their breakfast as fast as possible
and run to ensure themselves the best selling spots. In any case,
all healthy residents must leave the Lodge%
\footnote{The Lodge remains open under special circumstances, such as especially
harsh weather.%
} by half past six, so the Lodge can be cleaned and the wardens can
finish their administrative duties. Children seeking admission can
ask at any time, day or night. 

At one o'clock the Lodge opens again, but only for those who are paying
for the midday lesson, which is roughly the equivalent of first to
third grade. More advanced lessons are given during the evening. Both
residents and non-residents are welcome in the school, provided they
pay their dues.

The Lodge is fully open again at four o'clock, with the residents
being able to attend school or use the common room for recreation,
socialization or even doing their homework; dorms are out-of-bounds
until eight o'clock.

Right after dinner one of the wardens shares a daily tip, story or
message, reminds the residents of any rules they aren't following,
gives a short good-night lecture or shares a story.

On Sundays, the Lodge is never closed. There's always some common
recreation offered at five o'clock, which usually involves some form
of comic play and music.\medskip{}



\chapter{The Newsboy Code\label{cha:The-Newsboy-Code} }

\lettrine{E}{}very human organization has some rules which its members
are supposed to follow. Newsies are a class or a group of reference,
more than a group of belonging. In other words, newsies do not consider
each and every newsboy or newsgirl their family, but feel somehow
linked to them. So, in truth there is no Newsboy Code; there are many
small bands of newsies and each band has its own code. In most cases,
but for a pack or two of newsgirls, the code is more assumed than
written or even spoken. Rather than being a law, the code expresses
what other newsies of your same pack are expecting from you, and what
you can expect from them. Players are heartily welcomed to create
their own Newsies Code. However, speaking in general terms, most groups
use a code similar to the following seven rules: 


\subsection*{1. You care for each other. }

That's fundamental. If you don't care for us why should we care for
you? Can you live on your own? You don't need no help? You feel better
if nobody is telling you anything? Then go with nobody and leave us
alone. If you care for us, we'll care for you. We'll bring you to
the doctor when you are sick and buy you medicine if we can spare
the money. If you get into trouble we'll sort it out. And you'll do
the same for us. 


\subsection*{2.­ You don't get anybody in trouble. }

If a cops asks about somebody and they have not killed somebody, kidnapped
an old lady or bullied somebody smaller than they are, or something
nasty like that, you don't go tellin'. Nor do you go and tell any
lies or jokes about anybody, 'specially if they've been in the pens%
\footnote{Reform school.%
} before. Somebody could hear and he'd be in trouble. And you too,
we'll see to that. 


\subsection*{3.­ You ain't no slacker. }

We are all workin' hard to sell our papers. If you get lucky and sell
yours early, you help those who aren't so lucky and they will help
you another day. If you are too good for us, then you can just leave
us alone. If you wake up too late or just care about sellin', or can
live without butter, that's your choice. We believe it's tough being
poor and the sooner we get rich, the better. 


\subsection*{4.­ You ain't no coward. And if you ain't brave, you fake it. }

We don't mind people peeing in their pants. We'll, by Jingo, laugh
at it, but we don't mean anything wrong; it's just too funny. If you
run away when the rest of us are in big trouble, then you'd better
not come back. We could forgive you if it's something very, very scary\ldots{}
or not. 


\subsection*{5.­ You care for toddlers and old people. }

If you see a small kid cryin' all alone and there's nobody around
helpin', you go and fix it yourself. You don't want a wee one endin'
up like us, do you? Tell us and we'll all help him find his parents
or find him a place so he doesn't have to sleep in the ``pet''%
\footnote{An underground train station.%
}; remember that? If you don't care about the kid, go to the next corner,
turn west and keep walkin' till you get to California and then keep
swimming until you see China. 

Don't make fun of old people; it ain't funny at all. If you are sittin'
in the pet%
\footnote{The New Paris Elevated Train Company (NPET).%
} and an old lady comes in, you give her your seat. 


\subsection*{6.­ You keep yourself clean and tidy. }

How clean? Boy, you don't need to rub your pants with a cotton ball
to show us, but please, do not smell. And don't do something smelly,
specially not when you're with a client; you'd give us all a bad name.
And I don't care if you called us a girl or anything like that; we
want no pigs around here. 


\subsection*{7.­ You don't do no crimes. }

So you don't steal, you don't shortchange%
\footnote{Some groups don't mind a little shortchanging or even pickpocketing.%
} and you make no fuss. If you do, besides being mean and evil, you
put the whole group in trouble. You are givin' us newsies all a bad
name. We aren't telling the cops if you do things like taking an apple,
but we will be mad with you if you go bullyin', and if you keep doin'
things like that without good reason. We will send you away. And if
you do somethin' really wrong and mean, then we don't tell the cops,
we will beat you up and take you to court ourselves. 


\subsection{New Paris City }


\section{Introduction}


\subsection{\noindent Fore­word}

It\textquoteright{}s some year between 1890 and 1910. Some­where south
of New York and north of Vir­ginia lies the state and city of New
Paris. This very first line drafts the spirit of this game; New Paris
City is not and will not ever be defined. It\textquoteright{}s yours
to develop, explore and live. I know there are many who pre­fer to
have every­thing set up for them; they are lucky because there are
many excel­lent set­tings for them to choose from.

I believe in the power of sug­ges­tion. Every work of fic­tion sug­gests:
from Beowulf through Oliver Twist, to the last best­seller, an author
kindles the spark of imag­i­na­tion that resides in the read­ers.
It is them who fin­ish his work, ever new with each gen­er­a­tion
and per­son. A nar­ra­tive game, such as this, should do exactly that.
My role as author is merely to pro­vide the essen­tial mate­ri­als
the game mas­ter needs to, in turn, spark the story in the imag­i­na­tions
of the gam­ing group who -- pay atten­tion -- help him to cre­ate
the adven­ture, to unfold the world and to build a bet­ter setting.

Who am I to fet­ter all that in words of stone? 


\subsection{A bit of history}

New Paris began its life as a French set­tle­ment in the mouth of
the River Onhat­tan. Iso­lated from other French possessions, too
close to Vir­ginia, it was promptly taken by the British, despite
its mag­nif­i­cent defenses. Since then, it has shared the fate of
what would become the United States of America.

New Paris was spared the worst of the Civil War, with only a few skir­mishes
fought inside its bor­ders, and since then it has grown rapidly, to
rival the likes of Chicago or New York.


\subsection{A bit of technology}

New Paris, as the rest of the nation, is expe­ri­enc­ing a period
of technological progress. Though, this comes in dif­fer­ent speeds,
the wealthy take it faster, the poor more slowly. The first auto­mo­biles
run along­side mule-drawn carts and while a few man­sions can sport
the nov­elty of elec­tric lightbulbs, most peo­ple resort to petrol
lights. Pocket watches exist as a lux­ury item while most peo­ple
resort to using church bells or the town­hall clock to keep track
of time. Steam­ers have taken their place as ships of the line and
transatlantic traders, but sails are still a com­mon sight in every
harbor.

The com­mon peo­ple are fas­ci­nated and fright­ened by all this new
techonol­ogy and the changes it\textquoteright{}s bring­ing. Sci­ence
seems boundless. Who knows what some sci­en­tist could be doing some­where:
steam mans, fly­ing machines, ships that could reach the moon, Mars,
Jupiter or the far stars? Can elec­tric­ity bring the dead back to
life? Or, is the world to die through the negligence of some overly
enthu­si­as­tic doctor? 


\subsection{New Paris and its precincts}

New Paris is divided into six rough areas as seen on the map: Royal
Island, Inner Expanses, West Gate, Outer Expanses, Con­cor­dia and
the Decree Slums. Royal Island is a mod­ernist dream: the place of
the wealthy and the learned, filled with gaudy build­ings, fash­ion­able
parks, libraries and muse­ums. The seat of the New Paris Gov­er­ment
is there, along with the main offices of the largest and more con­ser­v­a­tive
cor­po­ra­tions. A few news­boys are born into this place, the unfor­tu­nate
chil­dren of a too trust­ing young maid and a bold young heir, or
that\textquoteright{}s what the ``prune ladies'' say.

The Inner Expanses is the nat­ural birth­place of the inde­pen­dent
young boy. This pre­vi­ously afflu­ent area is now home to man­sions
turned into tenen­ment build­ings by ever divid­ing its inte­rior
into smaller and smaller one-room homes. 

West Gate has risen to become the home of a new class of entre­pe­uners.
The New Paris Stock Exchange is located there, along with the most
impor­tant news­pa­pers and lawyers. Money is the blood of West Gate
and its heart is always pump­ing. There is not a day or hour in which
you cannot find some­one work­ing in a new business.

A sea of fac­to­ries and ware­houses, smoke and rushed traffic; that\textquoteright{}s
the first impres­sion a vis­i­tor has of the Outer Expanses. Yet this
new and most impor­tant har­bor of the city is there too. There are
more than a few rows of tall, yet dirty and squalid apart­ment build­ingsto
see. Many fac­tory work­ers only walk as far as their job and back
to their apart­ment, with lit­tle hope of sav­ing enough money so
their chil­dren can have a chance. Many die long before that.

Con­cor­dia lies south of the River Onhat­tan. Nice, ordered and clean,
Con­cor­dia is much more mixed and var­ied than any of the other areas
of the city. Con­cor­dians con­sider them­selves tol­er­ant, hard-working,
lovers of inno­va­tion and change. Not all change is always wel­comed,
such as the tra­di­tional small shops who face a tougher and tougher
com­pe­ti­tion from the depart­ment stores. Shop­ping and small work­shops
aside, the other major income of Con­cor­dia is recre­ation, in which
the New Paris beach plays a large role. Though lim­ited to the sum­mer
sea­son, the beach and its prom­e­nade attracts crowds of vaca­tion­ers
around the nation of every sta­tion in life.

And then we have Decree, locked between the sea and the New Paris
dump. Once, they were the home of the wealth­i­est, until the Great
Plague of New Paris changed all that. Aban­doned in days, it took
years for the home­less, the poor, the crim­i­nal and the des­per­ate
to slowly fill it. Year after year, New Paris for­got about Decree,
referr­ing to it as if it were a coun­try beyond the sea. Soon, street
fights turned into an eternal war among gangs. This is a den of poverty,
sick­ness and crime. Vio­lence is rampant and rumor has it that some
of their chil­dren end up as slaves in some exotic cor­ner of the
Earth. The news­boys, boot­blacks and oth­ers who run from this place
often keep their ori­gins to them­selves and make a point of never
returning. 


\section{A bundle of newspapers\label{sec:Newspapers}}

The most famous of the literally, dozens of competing newspapers%
\footnote{Most of which close in a year, only to see new ones open.%
} scattered all over New Paris are:


\subsection{The New Paris \emph{Dove} }

Motto: ``Not a single passive voice''.

Founded in 1850, the New Paris \emph{Dove} produces a basic English,
illustrated, 16-page newspaper targeted to housewives and working
women. Its stories have a feminine focus and a local feel. It is supplemented
with housekeeping, tips for administrative and clerical work, beauty
and lately, political agitation. The \emph{Dove} is particularly vocal
on the suffragette movement and supports womens' vote. This has branded
it as being irresponsible in the eyes of the Conservatives. 

Published daily, the New Paris \emph{Dove} sells better in Concordia,
than Royal Island, the Expanses or West Gate.
\begin{description}
\item [{Price:}] 2 cents (unit) -- \$1.50 bundle of 100
\item [{Reliability:}] B
\item [{Quality:}] C
\end{description}

\subsection{The Republican \emph{Hawk} }

Motto: ``Patriotic Truth''.

The most conservative daily newspaper in New Paris, \emph{The Hawk}
still officially operates from its offices in Royal Island, though
most of the work is carried out in Newspaper's Row. \emph{The Hawk}
has a strict policy for their newsboys, accepting only those who are
\emph{warranted }by other newsboys. Nobody wearing C-grade or worse
clothes need apply.

\emph{The Hawk} sells well only in West Gate and Royal Island, though
it's possible to sell a few in Concordia.
\begin{description}
\item [{Price:}] 10 cents (unit) -- \$4 bundle of 100%
\footnote{Many newsboys pool their money to buy a bundle.%
}
\item [{Reliability:}] B
\item [{Quality:}] A
\end{description}

\subsection{The \emph{Children's Newspaper}}

Motto: ``News for the quick youth''

Packed with comic strips, the \emph{Children's Newspaper} leaves little
room for simplified news, tips about school, homework, housekeeping,
good manners, religious practice, finding jobs and making friends.
Published every Saturday, the \emph{Children's Newspaper} sells better
in Concordia, than Royal Island%
\footnote{Rich fathers consider the comic strips to be a questionable influence
for their children, though mothers tend to think the opposite.%
} and West Gate, being hard to market anywhere else. 

The \emph{Children's Newspaper} is owned by the \emph{Dove} and includes
friendly contributions from very young persons%
\footnote{The game master could ask for an Academics check, with a TN of 15
for the first trial, lower it to 13 on the second and successive trials.
After the character has sold his first article, the TN could be set
at 11.%
}, paying 60 cents for a 300-word unsolicited article of average quality
and interest.
\begin{description}
\item [{Prices:}] 3 cents (unit) -- \$2 bundle of 100
\item [{Reliability:}] A
\item [{Quality:}] B
\end{description}

\subsection{The New Paris \emph{Star} }

Motto: ``News in your hands''.

The New Paris \emph{Star} is little more than a four-page newspaper
packed with large headings and dozens of minimalist articles written
in very simple English and featuring ``Mr. Oldstyle'', a daily comic
strip poking fun at the expense of the Royal Island gentry.

Newsies that sell the \emph{Star} are nicknamed ``inkpots'', as
the \emph{Star}'s ink takes hours to dry, staining the hands and clothes
of their young sellers.

The \emph{Star} sells well in both the Expanses and the poorest areas
of Concordia.
\begin{description}
\item [{Prices:}] 1 cents (unit) -- 50 cents for a bundle of 100
\item [{Reliability:}] C
\item [{Quality:}] D
\end{description}

\subsection{The \emph{Lighthouse}}

Motto: ``Truth and Honesty''.

A daily evening news publication, the \emph{Lighthouse}'s bundles
are available for distributors at four o'clock. The \emph{Lighthouse}
attracts its clients through non-partisan, well-written and researched
news articles, and practical information about small business management
and the economy. 

The \emph{Lighthouse} sells well in West Gate and Concordia, but it's
hard to market anywhere else.
\begin{description}
\item [{Prices:}] 2 cents (unit) --- 80 cents for a bundle of 100
\item [{Reliability:}] A
\item [{Quality:}] C
\end{description}

\subsubsection*{Rumors}
\begin{itemize}
\item C: The \emph{Lighthouse} holds a competition each year to choose three
new journalists apprentices.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The \emph{Prometheus Herald}}

Motto: ``Brave news for a brave new world''.

The \emph{Prometheus Herald} is the voice of the Utopist Movement,
a largely disorganized mass of young radicals with little in common
but their desire of constitutional reforms and the wealth of their
parents. The \emph{Prometheus Herald} regularly features a column
for translated articles from the most extremist philosophers in Europe
and elsewhere.

Like \emph{The Hawk}, the \emph{Prometheus Herald} has a strict policy
for their newsboys, accepting only those who are \emph{warranted }by
other newsboys. Nobody wearing C-grade or worse clothes need apply.

The \emph{Prometheus Herald} has a relatively small but fanatically
loyal following in Royal Island and Concordia, being hard to sell
anywhere else. 
\begin{description}
\item [{Prices:}] 8 cents (unit) -- \$3.50 bundle of 100%
\footnote{Many newsboys pool their money to buy a bundle.%
}
\item [{Reliability:}] C
\item [{Quality:}] A
\end{description}

\subsubsection*{Rumors}
\begin{itemize}
\item C: Newsies selling the \emph{Prometheus Herald} have been arrested
on occasion for no good reason, with their bundles confiscated.
\item C: Mr. Hawk, controls both the \emph{Prometheus Herald} and the Republican
\emph{Hawk}, and hires the same journalists for both newspapers.
\end{itemize}

\section{Royal Island }

\noindent Royal Island is in fact, a peninsula where the French settlers
landed in 1599. Soon surrounded by English colonies, it was ultimately
captured in 1732 after months of siege by land and sea. Today, it
is the most fashionable section of the city. Destroyed in the war
of 1812, it was rebuilt, paying a close look to the most charming
quartiers, its European namesake. Since then, it has attracted the
wealthy, the powerful and the intellectual. Few newsboys are native
of this area, yet more than you might think at first sight, for not
a small number of maids and servants live in their master's homes,
and not all the love stories between a lovely maid and a sparking
young gentleman have a happy ending. 

If there is a place in America where people are conscious of their
class, that is Royal Island. Royal Islanders will make a point to
display their station in life both in public and in private, paying
close watch to fashion, cultural trends and manners. Royal Islanders
do not befriend their domestic servants or other ``communers'',\emph{
}nor will they show sympathy to those striving for a share of the
American Dream. Above all, they despise the ``new-rich'', meaning
those who have earned their own wealth instead of inheriting it.

Royal Island finds its southern­most limit in the St. Louis Fort\,(4)%
\footnote{Numbers in brackets refer to the map.%
}, a star-shaped fortress built according to the specifications of
the Marquis of Vauban, a renowned French Engineer, who being an orphan,
slowly raised to the ranks of the aristocracy. Though officially renamed
twice as Fort St. George and more recently Fort Liberty, the people
of New Paris still refer to it as either the St. Louis or French Fort.
Today, it serves as the permanent headquarters of the New Paris National
Guard. 

Royal Island's long, wide avenues with ample sidewalks, adorned by
trees, art nouveau and neoclassic statues compete with the houses
and public spaces in their display of beauty. Nothing that is dirty,
blemished or plain is looked upon favorable in Royal Island. 

The best architecture of the city is located around the Flower Square.
There lay the Grand New Paris Opera Palace\,(7), a modernist building
decorated with motives of famous operas and classic plays. At its
front, across the square, students and the odd professor enter or
leave the New Paris Centennial Library\,(8) host, behind its sturdy
neoclassical walls of thousands of volumes. The Hall of Conferences
found on the first floor of the Library has become internationally
famous. The likes of Hegel, Darwin, Feuerbach, Maxwell and Carnegie
have given vivid and hotly debated conferences here. Such an occasion
congregates an audience open to the most expensive scientific and
philosophical journals. More than one poor lad of quick mind has found
a way to build up an education to promote his advancement in life
just by listening to its weekly sessions and acquired contacts. In
many ways, the Centennial Library offers ways of advancement to those
with an academical bent. 

During the night, Royal Island stays alive thanks to the many gaslight
lanterns that line its streets. The blessing is being received with
increasing disgust by the most conservative, who for some reason,
object to seeing a too cheerful of a youngster shouting the last opera
with an overly optimistic voice and a not fully sober mind. A D-class
rumor has it, that some of these youngsters have been kidnapped by
the servants of some angry old gentleman with ample means and good
contacts. 

On vacations, students from the nearby and prestigious University
of Mount St. Michel are regular patrons; some say permanent residents
of the most romantic cafés. There, listening to chamber music, whether
in the Sitzimlebem (9) the Kaiser und Koëning, the Hope \& Glory or
the Mizpelt, they debate with furious passions the latest scientific
theory, philosophical essay and the coming ­but always \emph{not-yet}
Utopist revolution. Meanwhile, some too conservative to be conservative
students gather around a good glass of wine and the latest sensations
on the piano in cafés like the New American, the Jingoist and the
Tripoli. 

There is a revolution for the dissolution of the states and the building
of a strong central government. An even stronger military is often
proposed as quickly turned down for another bottle. The Naiad Café
is almost never the home of the student, but rather the rally point
of young women who consider themselves \textquotedbl{}the spear point
of the Avant Garde\textquotedbl{}, the revolutionary philosophers
who are to change the world from a feminist point of view and place
of being. They are often ridiculed for their radical ideas which include
the strange notion that women are mature enough to vote without assistance
or influence from their husbands. 

The Famous Four of New Paris City is the informal name assigned to
its most important hotels. First things first, it is quite hard to
get employment there because they pay so well. Half of the staff,
of which there are several hotel boys and apprentices, live and eat
on the premises for a slightly smaller salary, with the remaining
staff residing in the Inner Expanses or Concordia. The long hours
of work and few free days, even at Christmas, do not leave much time
for adventuring. The Glory of the Nile, filled with orientalist paintings
and themed decor is looked at with some contempt as being the place
of choice for the new rich. It sports its own theater, open to the
general public, which offers a variety of Asian, Eastern European
and Northern African music hardly found anywhere else around the nation.
Contrary to the general belief spread by \textquotedbl{}My Love, My
Light, My End\textquotedbl{}%
\footnote{A romantic novel on the misadventures of a writer who commits suicide
after finding that he loves two lovers with equal passion, and yet
believes true love must be devoted to just one woman.%
} , the Glory of the Nile does not admit unmarried couples as clients. 

The New Paris Hotel, the oldest of the Famous Four, beats them all
for their cooks and waiters. Indeed, it is not unheard of to register
as guests for the pleasure of dining its delicacies. The Palace of
the Moon has a reputation for being a nest of foreign spies and plotting
politicians, though it is probably a false (D-class rumor). A more
sober guide should tell you that the Palace of the Moon tends to attract
a rather egocentric lot of guests and that its staff is the most helpful.
Finally, Hotel Concordia offers a very conservative look in its neoclassical
building. For their business guests, the hotel has a team of secretaries
and clerks in the premises, as well as meeting and office rooms.

\subsection*{Petit Street\label{sub:Petit-Street}}
\begin{description}
\item [{Location:}] Royal Island, near the New Paris Library
\item [{Description:}] Informally known as Petit Street for ages, the name
was officially recognized only recently. Petit only sports six buildings
on each side, each divided into small single-room apartments, with
no kitchen and a shared bathroom. The rooms are furnished with Provenzal-style
decoration. However, as both kitchen and bathroom are shared, these
apartments are favored only by those maids who don\textquoteright{}t
live at their master\textquoteright{}s and who cannot afford anything
better. As it can be expected, the street is only lively on Sundays
and holidays.
\item [{Businesses:}] There are only two businesses in Petit, the Petit
Café, a four-table café and tea house and Mrs. Whitecotton's Shop,
a small general store specializing in homemaking supplies.
\item [{Good~Market:}] The \emph{Dove}, Poems
\item [{Rumors}]~\end{description}
\begin{itemize}
\item E: Badly behaved children who do something nasty on this street can
wake up transformed into were-mice for one full day. (Source: \emph{The
bully who woke up as a mouse}, a children\textquoteright{}s story.)
\item B: There is a job notice board in Mrs. Whitecotton's Shop for housekeepers,
maids, pages, errand boys, butlers and similar trades. Mrs. Whitecotton
herself interviews the candidates and her recommendations most often
guarantee a job. 
\item D: A tunnel network that connects the buildings of Petit Street, lead
to an underground chamber where a group of suffragettes meet.
\end{itemize}

\section{Old Harbor }


\subsection{Introduction to Old Harbor}

While a part of Royal Island, the Old Harbor district is distinctive
enough to deserve its own section. Here the preoccupation for art
and culture quickly gives way to mercantilism and industry. For the
last two decades, Old Harbor has been catering for local trade, while
the New Harbor in the Outer Expanses serves as a hub for national
trade. Yet, its importance even as a local port is declining with
the arrival of the first automobile trucks. 

New forms of industries are emerging on the facilities, starting with
the yachts of the wealthy. These are attracting a new flood of goods
and services maintaining those ships and catering to the needs of
their owners and guests. Yawl sailing has become a sport of its own
right and the building, selling and renting of these leisure boats
provides not a small source of income. Less profitable but immensely
more popular, especially among children, are the weekly Tiny Boats
Regattas in which model boats compete against each other on closed
lanes. 


\subsection{The Wesson \& Wesson General Store}
\begin{description}
\item [{Description:}] Besides the wharves and the warehouses, the most
distinctive building of Old Harbor is the Wesson \& Wesson General
Store, located at the precinct line between Old Harbor and Royal Island.
Built in the guise of an oversized gothic tower and considered by
the most learned a \textquotedbl{}pastiche\textquotedbl{} of medieval
and Renaissance art, it still succeeds at attracting crowds from the
whole of New Paris and beyond. Its nine levels are renowned all around
the nation for the superb quality, rich variety and heavy prices of
the goods sold there. Nobody with C-clothes or worse would be admitted
as clients. However, it could be a source of employment for boys and
girls of any age as shopping aides who ­carry their client's parcels,­
or as apprentices in various roles; the company would provide for
their uniform, though entry requires good contacts, except in times
of heavy sales. 
\end{description}

\subsubsection*{Rumors}
\begin{itemize}
\item E: There is a goblin living somewhere in Wesson \& Wesson.
\item D: A diamond was lost in the store.
\item D: There is a man who kidnaps children who get lost there, never to
be found again.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Captain James K. Tiberius Sailor School}

Another place worthy of noting is the Captain James K. Tiberius Sailor
School. This school accepts students sent by the court on probation,
in exchange for a minor sentence, though most boys choose to enter
on their own volition. While conditions are much less severe than
those of a typical reform school where students are free to roam the
streets on weekends, boys placed there by the court must remain until
the grant of their Able Sailman certificate. This process usually
lasts at least three years. Graduates from this school have very good
prospects in both the merchant and the US Navy. 


\subsubsection*{Rumors}
\begin{itemize}
\item E: An angel visits this school on Christmas Day.
\item C: The best pupils of the year will be chosen for an explorative journey
to places where no American has gone before.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Tiny Boat Regattas}

Every Sunday at dawn, five veteran seamen arrive at the mostly deserted
Rooster Dock and divide a section of it into a dozen narrow lanes.
Then they share a breakfast of coffee and herrings. Slowly, a crowd
of children and their families gather around them, waiting for the
first 12 boats and their young skippers. The Tiny Boat Regattas will
begin with the participants in the water holding their models; then
Tim ``Old Sailor'', the self-appointed leader of the five veteran
seamen will drop a buoy. The children swim alongside their models,
trimming the sails and rudder as they go; taking great care not to
push them too much and risk disqualification.


\subsection{Old Harbor rumors}
\begin{itemize}
\item E: The Flying Dutchman will \emph{almost} dock here next Halloween.
\item D: I know somebody who knows an old sailor who knows about the hidden
treasure of Blackbeard, the Pirate.
\item C: Next week, the Tiny Boat Regattas will feature wire-guided miniature
steamships.
\end{itemize}

\section{Inner Expanses}

\noindent This area was the first one to be settled after Royal Island.
It suffered much less during the war of 1812, becoming the fashionable
part of the antebellum New Paris. However, after the reconstruction
of Royal Island and the return of the old families to their heritage
properties, the Inner Expanses became poorer and poorer. Today, the
once proud homes of the wealthy have become tenant buildings, each
room housing an entire family of immigrants from all around Europe.
Italian, German, Yiddish, Polish and French are among the many languages
that compete with English.

The proximity of the Inner Expanses to West Gate and Concordia, through
the river Onhattan, is bringing some prosperity back to the district.
However, in some cases that has forced some residents to move elsewhere
as more modern buildings and new businesses open to replace their
old homes. The most vibrant of these is Newspaper's Row, an area of
four streets boiling with the activity sprung by newspapers and publishing
houses.

It is little wonder that the New Paris Society for Children bought
and rebuilt an abandoned mansion here to serve as the Newsboy's Lodge.
It came cheap and allowed its clients\emph{ }easy access to the newspaper
houses, plus many opportunities for advancement.


\subsection{Mrs. O'Dougherty's Apple Stand}

Somewhere on a bend of a minor street, under an old maple tree, just
a few minutes from Newspaper's Row, lies a humble booth filled with
cheap yet fresh local fruit -- mostly apples -- and home-baked cookies.
She opens a little before dawn, just in time for her favorite clients:
newsboys and bootblacks eager for a cheap meal.

Mrs. O'Dougherty looks unbelievably old to newsboys, and equally wise.
She always has time for a motherly counsel but not with the lazy or
the pickpockets -- not until they set themselves to honest work, that
is. 

Polio\emph{ }Tim, a six-year-old she adopted informally, and Sir Percy,
a playful fox, are always with her. Tim walks around on his crutches,
attracting customers with his graceful voice, while Sir Percy keeps
both bullies and rats at bay.


\subsection{Inner Expanses rumors}
\begin{itemize}
\item D: The maple tree by Mrs. O'Dougherty's Apple Stand marks the spot
where the New Paris pioneers signed peace with the Indians. Cutting
it down would bring a horrible fate to the culprit and to New Paris.
\item D: Some of the treasures of the rich were left behind, forgotten,
when they returned to Royal Island.
\item B: Mrs. O'Dougherty personally knows each and every child who is on
his or her own in New Paris. Every single night she prays for them.
\item A: Watch out for fires. The tenant buildings in Inner Expanses are
prone to catching fire.
\item E: Chief Seven Thousand Tears, the leader of the local Indians at
the time of the colonization, roams the night as a ghost, cursed to
cry for all eternity, until somebody reveals to him the location of
the remains of his seven daughters.
\end{itemize}

\section{West Gate }


\subsection{Introduction}

West Gate means business; big business. Here is where you see the
Free Enterprise Tower, the tallest building in the world. This is
also where you will see armies of clerks heading every morning to
their jobs and back home again. It's a great market for both newsies
and bootblacks early in the morning and for food vendors. West Gate
features the New Paris Stock Exchange, the most important financial
institution in the Western Hemisphere, if not of the world. Only a
selected few of the newsies can sell their papers there, but those
who get inside would not only be able to sell a few bundles daily;
they could, with persistent effort, great charm and a happy day or
two, make great business contacts. A whole campaign could be devoted
to this endeavor. 


\subsection{Plus Ultra Park}

Plus Ultra%
\footnote{Beyond.%
} Park is the most modern public garden in New Paris, built to commemorate
the exploration and colonization of the American continent. As such,
it is widely used for patriotic events and it's the place where the
Newsboy Lodge holds its annual Newsboy Singing Contest on Thanksgiving. 

Besides an open air auditorium and a series of small neoclassic shrines
dedicated to the explorers of America and famous Native nations embossed
with allegorical designs, the park features four gardens displaying
the flora of the United States, Mexico, South America and Europe.


\subsection{The Mid­night Café }
\begin{description}
\item [{Description:}]~
\end{description}
The Mid­night Café guests enter through a nar­row oak door to dis­covera
short hallway fash­ioned with a foun­tain. There they will be wel­comed
by a bare­foot page dressed like the prince of an ori­en­tal­ist paint­ing,
and who will offer a piece of bread and a sip of tea.

At first sight, the Mid­nightCafé looks just like any other New Paris
café. Inside, there are two rows of square tables and a bar, only
with an ori­en­tal theme.

Yet, a curi­ous guest might notice the rather plain stairs that lead
to the sec­ond level. Once there, the new­comer should be ready for
a sur­prise. The whole level is empty but for a long and nar­row low
table that spi­rals whim­si­cally through­out the room in the likeness
of a ser­pent. Guests, and even staff on occa­sion, sit cross­legged
by this table on the rich car­petswhere they calmly con­verse.It is
not strange to find a chim­ney sweep speak­ing to the son of a lawyer,
nor a young gen­tle­man spend­ing time with an old porter. Once in
a while you will find some­body sharing a story, singing a song, playing
an instru­ment or showing some piece of art.

The third level, closed to guests, is where the staff lives. Rooms
are small but cozy, dec­o­rated in the most mun­dane fashion with
ample com­mon space. 
\begin{description}
\item [{Loca­tion:}] The Mid­night Café should be located in West­ Gate,
in some out-of-the-way alley; yet, it would not be out of place in
Con­cor­dia or even in the Inner Expanses. 
\end{description}

\subsubsection*{Rumors}
\begin{itemize}
\item D: It is said that you can only find the Mid­nightCafé by chance,
on a cold, rainy day.
\item C: Those who can­notpay by any other means can still eat a basic meal
and drink a hot bev­er­age,pro­videdthey spend a few hours work­ing.
\item E: Angels in disguise enter the world through a trap ­dooron the sec­ondlevel.
\item B: Every­bodyis wel­comein the Mid­night Café.
\item D: A sin­is­tercult runs the Mid­night Café.
\item C: A phil­an­thropicsoci­ety runs the Mid­nightCafé.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{West Gate rumors}
\begin{itemize}
\item C: George ``Owl'' Henson, a lawyer, is looking for a new errand
boy and an apprentice, to live-in at the office. They must be well-mannered,
properly schooled, honest, discreet and hard-working.
\item D: The foundations of The New Paris Stock Exchange are weak and could
fall overnight.
\end{itemize}

\section{Outer Expanses }

\begin{center}
\medskip{}

\par\end{center}

The Outer Expanses is the main industrial area of New Paris, concentrating
the vast majority of factories and other industrial facilities that
deal mainly with manufactured goods. It also includes the New Harbor
where most of the trade arrives in New Paris; the old harbor in Royal
Island has become increasingly inadequate.

Children make up a substantial part of the workforce. The hours are
long, the pay is short and conditions can be dangerous, prompting
a large number of children workers to seek self-employment as newsies
or in other trades. Many of the workers come from the Inner Expanses
and the Decree Slums, with a few from Concordia; though these tend
to occupy the highest ranking positions.


\subsection{The Hook}

The Outer Expanses industrialists saw an opportunity for profit by
housing their own workers, and so the neighborhood known as the Hook
was born. The area is a closely packed group of tall buildings filled
with small apartments just north of New Harbor Station. They are bursting
with immigrant families from Italy, Ireland and Poland. 

The vast majority of the residents are working for the corporation
that owns their homes, a circumstance that places them in a weak position
at the bargaining table.


\subsection{The Farwells}

The Farwell family operates a small ketch that serves both as a home
and a business. They deal in books, tools, spices, exotic dried fruits,
teas, novelties and other specialty wares, brought according to demand
and their own preference, from Europe, Africa, China and the islands
of the Southern Seas, where they spend their winters.

Their colorful ketch, the \emph{Fair Moonlight}, anchors around Warren
Island from two to three weeks, according to personal and business
needs every year, usually in April.


\subsubsection*{Members of the crew}
\begin{itemize}
\item Family members: Arthur 35 years old, Elizabeth 34 years old, Peter
16 years old, Susan 14 years old, Perceval 12 years old, Harry 11
years old, Lucy nine years old, Pip eight years old and Saddy, their
golden retriever.
\item Staff: Usually one or two seamen and possibly a few apprentices.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Rumors}
\begin{itemize}
\item B: The Farwells will hire up to 12 newsies to market their wares as
they arrive in New Paris.
\item C: The Farwells could hire up to seven boys or girls of good disposition
for their annual round-the-globe journey.
\item E: The Farwells are in fact, a family of immortals, wizards or something
like that.
\item E: The Farwells often sail into worlds that are beyond the veil of
dreams.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Altberg Bank}
\begin{description}
\item [{Description:}] The Altberg bank is one of the many small banks
of New Paris. It is among those that allow a savings account to be
opened by any newsboy, no matter how young the chap is. Though, it
demands a minimum first deposit of \$1.00 and failing this, a newsboy\textquoteright{}s
best option is to deposit at the Newsboy Lodge.
\item [{Location:}] The main office is in Newspaper's Row, with branches
in Royal Island, Concordia and the Outer Expanses.
\end{description}

\subsubsection*{Rumors}
\begin{itemize}
\item D: There\textquoteright{}s an open position for an errand boy (B-grade
clothes or better).
\item E: The Altberg Bank is about to go bankrupt.
\item E: The vault of the Altberg Bank holds a secret chamber that leads
to a time machine.
\end{itemize}

\section{Concordia }

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{0.55\columnwidth}%
\end{wrapfigure}%
Concordia is the most modern, middle class and liberal precinct in
New Paris. Its residents see it as an assortment of four main areas,
each one with its distinctive flavor. North to south, these are: the
Beach, Cadened, L'Orient and Point South. The beach itself extends
into the Old Expanses, yet when New Parisians talk of \textquotedblleft{}the
Beach\textquotedblright{} they're usually referring to the area located
in Concordia. The area surrounding the beach differs slightly from
Cadened for most of the year, except for the smaller number of children
who live there and its reputation for being a dull place. However,
as the summer sun heats New Paris and the beach is flooded with families
searching for some respite, scores of businesses seem to sprout from
everywhere like spring poppies. 


\subsection{Cadened }

This is a mainly residential area, which is also the favorite of the
poor students and artists for its alternative (read-cheap) cafés and
the occasional charming park. The whole place has the feel of a village
that somehow became surrounded by the city. Inhabitants of Royal Island
consider Cadened little more than a bad imitation of their own quartier.
However, it is a pleasant place to live, devoid of serious crime,
filled with nice, charming hard-working people who earn their living
in small workshops instead of factories. This is the place where a
young Cecil Fauntleroy might have lived. 


\subsubsection{Miss Seton's School for Orphan Girls}

This school is in fact, a cute, small home for 12 children of up to
13 years of age. Miss Seton died ten years ago from old age, and today
two of \textquotedblleft{}her girls\textquotedblright{} run the home.
Anne, 14, the youngest of the two, chose to remain there, caring for
the \textquotedblleft{}wee ­ones\textquotedblright{}, earning some
money as she finishes her education at the Sangers Secretaries and
Administrative Studies Academy, not far from the school. Sylvia, 25
years of age, manages the paperwork and supervises the older girls.
Tuition is given by volunteer teachers sent by the New Paris Society
for Children. The place has three bedrooms for the girls, split into
different age groups, and three more for the resident workers, one
of which, Miss Seton's room is kept unused but clean, just as she
left it at the time of her death. Though most of the girls growing
up here end up earning scholarships for further education and/or typically
searching for jobs as teachers or in clerical positions, it is possible
that one or two more prone to adventure decide to begin their own
businesses. 


\subsubsection{Dr. Doiknow's Spiritual Cabinet}

The most curious building in the whole Cadened area is Dr. Doiknow's
Spiritual Cabinet. It is promoted as a ``place of spiritual healing
and communication with the never-departed''\emph{. }The cabinet itself
looks like a church with stained-glass windows. In contrast to Biblical
scenes the windows depict flying ghosts, empty coffins, chains of
everlasting flowers, pyramids and mummies. The sign on the door reads:
\begin{quotation}
\textquotedbl{}Knock thrice and the mystery of the ages shalt be revealed
to thee.\textquotedbl{}
\end{quotation}
Clients who oblige and offer a donation\emph{ }of at least \$1.00%
\footnote{That covers only the most basic spirit reading for new clients. Once
the doctor is able to fool their clients he will quickly increase
his prices to as high as he can get.\emph{ }%
} are led to a small, dimly lit, red room with a bare mahogany table
in the center, where Dr. Doiknow or some of his hired mediums ``consult
the spiritual lights''\emph{ }and ``serve as passages to the Spiritual
Grand Parallel Plane''\emph{}%
\footnote{Consider the whole operation as a D-class rumor. %
}\emph{. }The gaudy outlook of its walls and whimsical gargoyles, the
smell of incense and the sound of a distant piano only help to make
the experience much more intense.

Dr. Doiknow's Spiritual Cabinet always closes on Halloween, a time
when his neighbors often see -- or imagine -- strange beings through
the windows or around the home. 


\subsection{The New Paris Beach}

At sunrise, with the first low tide of the day, a small group of women
and children search for seafood on the sands of New Paris Beach, braving
the chilly waters of the Atlantic in their bare feet. The rest of
the day, throughout most of the year the whole place is almost deserted.

During the summer, however, the landscape changes radically as those
who can afford a break from their work laze on the sand. With vacationers,
come a host of workers: first, those who construct and maintain the
changing booths so ladies can change in private; teamsters leading
goat-drawn buggies and calm donkeys that take children for a ride;
peddlers of every sort who come to sell their wares to collect spare
change from parents. It makes a great opportunity for selling newspapers,
sweets and refreshments, yet the enterprising newsboy should be wary
of the pickpockets, especially if he's tempted to have fun by the
sea.

New Paris Beach sports every kind of modern facility: from lines of
rope that provide respite to weak swimmers to a long pier; from lifeguard
towers to a station of rental paddle boats; from a huge water toboggan
to a long bowery range.

Fashionable swimsuits in New Paris consist of a two-piece black wool
garment; the upper covering the trunk, with sleeves reaching to the
elbows, and the lower portion hanging to the knees. Poor kids, however,
just swim in their undies.

Older newsboys who are good at swimming might be hired as lifeguards
for the summer season. Apprentice lifeguards need to have at least
one month of training and must live-in at the premises. The Lifeguard
House, perched on a rock by the sea, is a lively building consisting
of seven rooms: the apprentices' dormitory, the lifeguards' dormitory,
an office, a storage room, a kitchen, a common room that doubles as
a lunchroom, and a hall where ceremonies take place. 


\subsection{L'Orient }

Located between Cadened and Point South, L'Orient was born when affluent
settlers from elsewhere in the United States and Europe did not find
a warm reception in the then more fashionable Inner Expanses. L'Orient
is today famous for its shops, attracting clients from all over the
state of New Paris. The higher classes\emph{ }of Royal Island would
never be seen shopping in the department stores of the nouveau-venu\emph{}%
\footnote{``Newcomers'', an insulting term meaning ``well-to-do'' persons
from somewhere other than Royal Island''.%
}, preferring the more luxurious shops of their own quartier. They
are not above sending their maids in search of some good sale.

L'Orient sports a zoo, which is but a glorified park filled with rows
of small cells for animals, including an old mountain lion. The alligator's
pond was recently transformed into a fish pond after a strange incident
took place two years earlier. Anybody with the slightest empathy will
see that the animals look stressed and sad.

The Shiloh Children's Hospital is a charitable institution that provides
cheap care for sick or injured children up to the age of 15. No child
is ever denied treatment for lack of money, though money helps with
such extras as not having to share the room -- or the bed.


\subsection{Point South\label{sub:Point-South}}

Point South is an experiment in human habitation created by the so-called
father of the Utopist Movement, Mr. Prometheus Goodwill. He took inspiration
on the spider's web for the disposition of the streets and beehives
for the homes. The result was a whimsical neighborhood of twisted
streets and hexagonal-shaped two-bedroom apartment buildings that
failed to attract the intellectual elite, the ``new cabin philosopher
class'', with which Mr. Goodwill dreamed.


\subsubsection*{Mr. Prometheus Goodwill Home}

Mr. Goodwill Home is a radical construction shaped in the guise of
an Egyptian temple surrounded by a large, wild garden in the very
center of Point South. Vacant since Mr. Goodwill's death, the deserted
house strangely enough, is in pristine condition.


\subsection*{Concordian rumors }
\begin{itemize}
\item C: An Egyptian pagan priest lives in Point South; D: He or she has
strange powers to bless and curse.
\item D: An outcast member or members of a minor royal family lives secretly
in Cadened.
\item E: There is at least one ghost child haunting the Shiloh Children's
Hospital. They can be seen praying or mourning when some doctor or
nurse makes a mistake.
\item D: The crocodiles from L'Orient Zoo escaped and live in the sewers.
\item E: A man-sized spider lives in the sewers under Point South. The critter
is poisonous and is smart enough to open a manhole at night as it
waits for rats, a stray cat or some other unsuspecting victim.
\item D: If a kid gets lost somewhere in New Paris, he could wake up in
a cell in Point South, head shaved, dressed only in a long white tunic,
his hands tattooed with strange Egyptian/Sumerian/Pagan symbols.
\item E: There is a haunted house near the Dr. Doiknow's Spiritual Cabinet;
C: Even those who mock the doctor fear that house.
\item C: The wolves at the L'Orient Zoo are in fact, dogs; B: If somebody
helps them escape they will prove to be independent beasts, yet fanatically
loyal to their liberators.
\end{itemize}

\section{Decree Slums }


\subsection{Introduction}

Nicknamed the ``Den of Perdition'', this is the place where you
end up when you have run out of choices. Though the slums are a city
in themselves and some areas are more akin to the Hook, in most cases
row after row of decrepit houses and one-family-to-a-room apartments
fill its streets. Like the Inner Expanses, it used to be a rather
wealthy neighborhood. After a sudden epidemic in 1890, its residents
fled the place, which was later colonized by the desperate.

The only way to get to the slums is to cross the narrow muddy path
that runs through the New Paris Landfill. When a boy born in Decree
dreams about escaping to the big city, the first obstacle he sees
is this wall of rotten despair.

Decree is a maze of narrow streets (at times not much wider than a
man), underground passages, covered bridges and secret cellars. Many
among the newsies are born here, though it is the worst place to sell
papers, as clients are more likely to steal than to buy. In fact,
rampant violence is one of the reasons many boys decide to try their
luck somewhere else. 

The Constabulary force has, for the most part, left the Decree Slums
to its own residents and only when pressured by the public, do they
execute a raid that usually ends up in the arrest of the unlucky who
get in their way.

The reputation of the Decree Slums is so strong that newsies from
this area tend to keep their origins to themselves; they know the
general public will see them as pickpockets and ruffians, and it's
tough to sell newspapers that way. 

On the coast of the Decree Slums, in sight of Lighthouse Island, there
is a low cliff. It is easy to climb down in calm weather. From this
shore a good swimmer may fight the strong currents that surround Decree
and reach the rock of Bizkaia Islet. They will find a cave that once
served as the solitary home of Mary Martian, a philosopher; her pages,
inventions and findings might still be there (D-class rumor).

People from the Decree Slums place a very high value on burial ceremonies,
saving every bit to ensure a \textquotedbl{}respectable tombstone\textquotedbl{};
most newsies from this area follow this custom.

\subsection{Decree rumors }
\begin{itemize}
\item B: The slums are built on an ancient burial ground.
\item C: The residents may resort to lynching.
\item A: There are several pickpockets and beggar hideouts led by adult
fagins.
\item D: If you dig deep enough or have maps, you'll be able to find treasure.
\item D: A few residents have coffins filled with gold and stolen valuables.
\item D: Decree roaches are large enough for a boy to ride on them; E: Some
do! They will not go anywhere in plain daylight, though.
\end{itemize}

\section{The sewers and the underground}


\subsection{The sewers}

Under the ground of New Paris is a world of which most of its residents
are unaware. This is the kingdom of rumors, criminal conspiracies
and strange stories. Getting to the sewers is easy. Before the New
Paris Society for the Protection of Children opened the Lodge, hundreds
of children made the sewers their home, especially in the cruelest
days of winter. Even today, a few bands of stray children live there. 

First, find an open manhole, which is easy in the Inner Expanses,
hard elsewhere and impossible in Decree; the sewers do not extend
to the Slums. Failing that, try to force the lock with a lever (Strength
TN of 15) or pick its lock, which is rather easy (Locks TN 10). Climb
down the iron steps where the brightest daylight fades quickly into
total darkness. Guided by a petrol lamp, you discover a narrow canal
of bubbling black water with a wet, slippery walkway on each side.
You walk on, braving the putrid air and the fear of sickness, hoping
for the treasure that must be waiting for you, somewhere. A startled
rat jumps into the stream, roaches climb on walls that you do not
dare touch. The canal bends and then forks into three branches where
a filthy iron bridge tempts you to cross. What was that in the water?
Could something live there? And what is that unnerving noise; that
distant wailing?

That is how an adventure could begin in the sewers. It often ends
with a bunch of kids lost in a maze of tunnels who finally come to
their senses and escape through the first manhole they are able to
find. The sewers have good use for the young pickpockets who can move
discreetly across the city, escape persecuting crowds to hide their
earnings from the fagins and bullies who prey on them. Everything
else is just a rumor.


\subsection{Sewer rumors}
\begin{itemize}
\item D: There are secret doors in the sewers that lead to underground cells
where the criminals of New Paris imprison their kidnapped victims.
\item D: An alligator, escaped from the Zoo, made his way into the sewers
and lives there, preying on rats and the occasional overly curious
kid.
\item D: A pack of seven newsboys play here in the tunnels, dressed up as
knights and wizards. They play a strange game about dungeons and goblins
and things like that. They obey some strange leader who calls himself
a game master.
\item C: The Flea Treasure.

\begin{itemize}
\item The Flea was a famous thief of the 1850s who poisoned people. He was
hanged for his crimes without ever revealing the location and nature
of his treasure. His mother died exactly one year afterward and a
letter written about the treasures, signed by the Flea, was found
half burnt near the stove. Unfortunately, most details were lost and
all attempts to recover it failed.
\item B: The cache includes a fine selection of poisons.
\item E: One of his potions will stop aging (including growing up) for 1
nd and six years.
\item E: An undead of some sort guards the treasure.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The underground}

As dark, and much more sinister than the sewers is the myriad of underground
tunnels that slither beneath the surface of the city. Most are not
connected with any other: the hideout of a gang, the temple of blasphemous
cultists and the secret laboratory of an evil scientist are built
to keep off prying eyes. A few, however, have secret doors or passages
leading to the sewers or to less than reputable saloons.

A chief example among these is the dungeon of Yeroe-Athian (C-class
rumor), the infamous pirate of the Wild Islands of the Southern Seas.
His junk, the \emph{Evil Moon}, does not dare to attack in American
waters. Instead, each year, on the night before the 4th of July, he
sneaks off to New Paris and lowers two boats that will take two dozen
unfortunates to serve as palace slaves for some Eastern Prince. Two
months before, his partners in New Paris will begin to scout for likely
victims: tramps and orphans who will not be missed. With some they
will use promises and lies, with others they'll drop blue poison into
their beverages, and for the rest they will resort to violence. In
any case, they will be escorted, bound, blinded and gagged through
the sewers, to the dungeon of Yeroe-Athian.

The dungeon is always a surprise to its inmates. Instead of a row
of damp, dirty cells on a narrow corridor, they find a subterranean
palace of Eastern splendor. Their relief is short-lived, as they are
soon put to work, learning their new duties until the time is right
for the \emph{Evil Moon}.


\section{The New Paris Elevated Train Company}

That's its official name, but most New ­Parisians, and every newsboy,
call it the NPET or even the ``Pet''. As in \textquotedblleft{}I'm
taking the \emph{Pet} to school\textquotedblright{}, when they refer
to the urban rail. There are only two circular lines: clockwise and
counterclockwise ­or just ``clock'' and ``counter'' in New Paris
slang. Both lines are mostly underground, though a few elevated sections
remain.

Clients access the trains through mechanical gates that must be fed
with tokens (Price 2 cents, rating E). It is possible to sneak under
these and fool the NPET workers, but if caught it would be considered
a D-class crime%
\footnote{See section \vref{sec:Crimes}.%
},­ so it isn't worth it. During winter nights, homeless adults (and
children who distrust the Lodge), hide and sleep in the underground
stations and tunnels until the NPET workers or cops make them leave.
Though it's technically a D-class crime, charges are rarely pressed;
station workers have forcefully evicted these offenders on occasion.

The Elevated Train Lines, despite their name, travel at ground level
for most of the journey, and are raised only in the most crowded areas.
In Royal Island the lines travel underground; the future of the New
Paris transportation system.

\part{Adventures}

\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{NBFinalIllust/0270-ornament-steam-ship-q75-500x247}

\lettrine{A}{}dventures are the heart of every role-playing game.
In fact, one of their many virtues is that you can play any adventure
you can dream of. With a little ingenuity and some effort, you can
adapt the rules to your own liking and setting. Designing your own
adventures is even easier. It may seem daunting to the novice game
master, but once you design two or three games you will agree the
only thing you needed was confidence. 

So, I could have left \emph{Newsies~and~Bootblacks} with no adventures
at all, trusting that the gamer would figure out what to do; just
as I learned by myself long ago. However, I also know we are often
starved for time, and that stress and responsibilities affect our
creativity. So from its very inception, I designed \emph{Newsies}
with the idea that it would be a complete game, without a strict need
to add any expansion. In the end, I decided to compromise, using a
technique I first encountered on the pages of the sadly discontinued
Spanish role-playing magazine \emph{Líder.} This is a technique that
fine games such as Prince Valiant or Time Lords have used, and what
I'm calling the summary adventure. 

Instead of page after page of prose, you have a few paragraphs with
the essential information needed to run the adventure; no more. I
know that once the foundations of an adventure have been established,
it is easy to fill up the other details during the game­and that,
no doubt, it's much easier to adapt to the player characters that
the players have actually created. 

For the sake of being a little systematic, and to help the novice
game master, I've set up an Adventure Structure, that has been explained
in the following section. You are, of course, not required to follow
this structure when you design your own adventures, but it is important
you understand it if you want to use the sample adventure included
in this book. More adventures will appear on the game's web page at
http://minimrpg.com.


\chapter{Adventure Structure }
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textquotedbl{}Extra, extra, read all about it!\textquotedbl{}: Abstract.
This is a narrative summary or hook for the adventure.
\item \textquotedbl{}Start here.\textquotedbl{}: Initial situation, explaining
what the players are doing when the game begins. It could be pretty
well an action scene.
\item Friends, foes and innocent bystanders.: A detailed list of non-player
characters, with the needed stats. It could include notes about the
player characters too if, for example, it's important for the story
that all are able to swim. 
\item \textquotedbl{}All you want is...\textquotedbl{}: Goal or goals of
the adventure. 
\item First act: The first act introduces the characters and the conflict.
Often, an act will have two or more alternative exits leading to some
other acts. Obviously a summary adventure cannot cover all possible
ideas that players can come up with, or every situation that could
arise within a game. Address only the most likely variants. It is
a game, so accept that you cannot control everything; let it flow.\\
Adventures can be divided into smaller chunks called scenes, which
allow for finer detail. This alternative requires a little more work
when designing the adventure, yet it makes game-mastering much easier
at play time. Acts allow faster adventure creation and preparation
at the cost of being a little harder at play time. Use acts if you
love improvisation.
\item Second act: The second act deals with the efforts of the player characters
and their opponents to solve the conflict.
\item Third act: (And, fourth, fifth, etc.). The third act deals with the
resolution of the conflict itself, and what surprises could be in
store. Most adventures should last for three acts only.
\item \textquotedbl{}It all turned out to...\textquotedbl{}: In this section,
the author of the adventure should detail the possible rewards for
the players if they ``win'' the adventure or the sad consequences
of defeat. This should include things like money, equipment, chits
gained, contacts made and skills gained, if any.Rumors and variants:
If you discover the players are having too easy a time, this section
adds rumors and possibly variants that you may include in the scenes
or acts, either to spice them up or increase their difficulty. Of
course, with increased difficulty comes an increased reward and the
number of chits gained could possibly change according to the variants
you use. It goes without saying that you can design your own variants
for the adventure. 
\item Bits and notes: This section is optional. Use it for anything that
doesn't fit anywhere else, such as optional rules or special equipment;
a pair of steampunk night vision goggles, for example. 
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{The Hidden Prince}
\begin{quotation}
\emph{\textquotedblleft{}Now cracks a noble heart. Good-night, sweet
prince; And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.\textquotedblright{}

\end{quotation}

\section{``Extra, extra, read all about it!''}
\begin{quote}
After a long, terrible adventure, fatty Prince Arthur of Borgonnia%
\footnote{Located between France and Germany.%
}, having escaped from the Prussian plot that doomed his family, and
a friend who was unfortunate enough to look almost like him, has arrived
as a stowaway to New Paris.
\end{quote}

\subsection{Initial adventure notes}

Prince Arthur, the youngest child of the Borgonnian Royal Family,
who was destined to inherit a castle and as many non-crown princes,
became a general of the Borgonnian Army. A Prussian plot changed all
this when, while he was playing hide-and-seek in the Royal Residence
Gardens, his entire family was killed before his very eyes, along
with Pierre, his best friend and many other nobles of every age and
gender. Not knowing what to do, he disappeared into the forests surrounding
the palace until he was able to board a French ship in Caen that he
believed was destined for England; Borgonnia's best ally.

In the confusion, the plotters did not discover the boy's survival
until three days later. Since then, they have done all that is possible
to cover that fact so they can kill him secretly. Meanwhile, they
are acting high and low in the Borgonnia House of Commons to nominate
a Prussian noble as the next King of Borgonnia; one who would sell
the crown to the Prussian Emperor. Several anarchist terrorists have
already been arrested by the Prussian Criminal Police. The Prussian
authorities will, as a matter of course, deliver the poor scapegoats
to the Borgonnian authorities for trial. Of course, the unfortunates
will die in transit, while ``trying to escape'',\emph{ }one week
after the beginning of this adventure.

Arthur was found by one of the ship's mates on his second day, and
was put to work as a cabin boy before being forced to leave the ship
in New Paris. 


\subsection{What players should know}
\begin{itemize}
\item German unification did not happen in the alternative history of this
adventure. Instead, Germany gathered into four nations: Prussia, Bayer,
the Northern German Confederation and Saxony. Of these, the most warlike
and powerful was Prussia.
\item Borgonnia is considered French by the French and German by the Germans,
though most of the population consider themselves Borgonnian.
\item The Borgonnian language is considered by many to be a mix of German
and French, though the Royal Borgonnian Academy considers it a proper
language on its own.
\end{itemize}

\end{description}
\bigskip{}


When the story begins, Arthur wears the rags of what used to be one
of his many light summer outfits. He looks slightly overweight, after
weeks of adventures and privation. He is also confused and doesn't
know who to trust. His only remaining valuable possession is the Medallion
of the Borgonnian Order of the Golden Griffin, of which he's a born
member.

Prince Arthur is not used to dealing with low-class children and will
act defensively. He excels at restraining his emotions, masking them
under a sad smile if he finds himself in trouble. Unfortunately for
him, his English is both extremely formal and plagued with grammatical
mistakes.
\begin{description}

role-player.

\end{description}
Hans is a Prussian agent charged with the mission of discreetly eliminating
the threat that Prince Arthur poses to Prussia's prestige and the
eventuality of a war with the British Empire. He is ruthless, methodical
and efficient, but feels lost in America. He is, of course, able to
speak English, yet with a marked German accent. Hans is just one of
the many other Prussian agents activated by Prussian embassies around
the world, so he's not particularly hopeful of finding the Prince.
Still, duty demands his best effort. Hans will not use his weapons,
except as noted in the text; otherwise he seriously fears for his
life.

\end{description}
Generic Prussian agents will carry on with the rest of the adventure
if Hans is arrested or incapacitated, or they will shadow the player
characters (see variant 1). They are much less imaginative and easier
to fool.
\begin{description}
\item [{Tags:}] Disciplined, dull, methodical, fearless.
\end{description}

\section{``Start here''}
\begin{description}
\item [{Location:}] Liberty Avenue, a long commercial street in Point South
\item [{Season:}] Summer
\item [{Date}] \& time: Around 1905 in August, on a Monday at 7:30 a.m. 
\end{description}
Tell the player characters it is just another morning and they have
newspapers to sell if they want to eat. Allow the player characters
to buy one newspaper bundle of their choice and means%
\footnote{See Section \vref{sec:Newspapers}.%
}, and start the adventure with them gathered on some street in Point
South%
\footnote{See Section \vref{sub:Point-South}.%
} from where they plan to disperse. 

As they are about to say goodbye to each other, Hans Dasistnorm, the
Prussian agent, will meet the group with a color%
\footnote{Though rare and experimental, color photography \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_photography}{did exist since the late XIX century.}%
} photograph of Prince Arthur on his tennis outfit. To the player characters
he will look just like another fat rich kid. The only sign of his
royal status will be a small golden crown printed on the photo. Hans
will tell the children that Arthur has fits of madness where he believes
himself to be some tragic character, such as a prince or a duke. 

Arthur's worried, well-to-do family are French winemakers who have
hired him as a private investigator. He will offer the newsboys the
handsome quantity of \$50 if they discreetly deliver Prince Arthur
to him or to the Prussian Consulate in Cadened, Concordia; he'll explain
that he has friends there. Before waving the player characters goodbye,
Hans will share how sad Arthur's mother is; ``the boy might be a
little deranged, but she still adores him%
\footnote{The game master may secretly check Hans' Performance skill against
a TN of 11, on a fail., He should tell the players that Hans does
not seem completely sincere, and that perhaps he's only concerned
about the reward.%
}.''

Hans will refuse to hand them the photograph, nor will he advance
any money for expenses.


\section{Scene 1: First sales}

Inform the players that they can sell%
\footnote{See ``Selling Rules'' in Section \vref{sec:Selling}.%
} their newspapers as usual, while still keeping an eye out for Arthur.
They have made quite an investment with their start-up money and will
be concerned for the success of their business.


\section{Scene 2: Bullies}

After two hours of selling, they will see a group%
\footnote{Adjust according to the size, equipment and abilities of the player
characters.%
} of bullies%
\footnote{See Appendix \vref{cha:A-cast-of}.%
} running after Arthur. The poor boy, still a bit overweight and not
used to running, will trip over a basket of fruit that lay by a grocer's
window. He will fall, belly first on a wagonload of tomatoes. The
bullies will proceed to attack Arthur and rob him of his remaining
valuables. In 1\,sd turn, the shopkeeper%
\footnote{Treat him as an ``Average Adult'', see Appendix \vref{cha:A-cast-of}%
} will appear, armed with a broom%
\footnote{Treat as a stick%
}; in 2\,sd turns, two members of the New Paris Constabulary will
arrive. The shopkeeper will attack any child in sight, treating them
all as troublemakers, while the New Paris Constabulary will act with
much more sense.

Should the player characters intervene, the bullies will fight them
until defeated or until the arrival of the constabularies. With the
exception of newspapers, the bullies will make their best attempt
to steal all the valuables from the player characters, including shoes
and coats.


\section{Scene 3: An orphan from Caen}

After the fight is over, the player characters may want to earn the
trust of Arthur. The boy, however, will claim to be an orphan from
Caen, in Normandy, France, who has just arrived at New Paris. He will
stick to this story because he does not expect anybody to believe
the truth, nor does he want to risk it. Under no circumstance will
he go to the Prussian Consulate, though he might agree to join the
player characters who are selling newspapers and seek admittance to
the Newsboy Lodge. The game master might hint to the players that
it is hard to break the shields of a stray child, especially one who
has just been in a fight.

Once the player characters earn Arthur's confidence, let them finish
selling their newspapers, and then spend the rest of the day as they
see fit; trying to earn extra money, having fun at the beach or exploring
the city, with as much or little detail as the game master wants.
It can go from the instruction ``...and you spend the rest of the
day together...'' to a full adventure on its own.

Let the day end at the Newsboy Lodge.


\subsubsection*{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item The bullies don't know anything about Arthur; they just saw him as
an easy target.
\item If the player characters intervene it would be much easier for them
to earn the trust of Arthur.
\item Don't roll dice to determine if the player characters win Arthur's
trust or not; let them role-play it and award it if they play it that
way. If in doubt, just flip a coin.
\end{itemize}

\section{Scene 4: A sneaky truth}
\begin{description}
\item [{Location:}] Exterior, on Newspaper's Row
\item [{Date:}] Dawn, in August, on a Tuesday
\end{description}
Right after having their oats and quarter sausage breakfast, the player
characters have arrived at Newspaper's Row as usual, to buy their
bundles. While waiting in line for the warehouse to open, Arthur will
open up a bit about his tragedy. If the player characters seem to
listen, he'll share that there's some bad man after him; ``He thoroughly
detested my father and murdered him and he wants to murder me too.''
If the player characters suggest going to the Constabulary, Arthur
will say something like; ``I reckon my father had some unsolved matters
with the authorities and I assume they believe I have also committed
something very wrong.\emph{}%
\footnote{\noindent The United States have much more interest in Prussia than
in Borgonnia, and while Arthur is no expert in foreign policy, he's
not sure of how the American authorities would react, if they don't
lock him up in an asylum in the first place. In that circumstance
he would be forced to lie to a policemen and he has the good sense
to know how bad an idea that would be. \\
Player characters would perhaps believe that the boy's parents were
involved in criminal business of one kind or another.%
}''


\section{Scene 5: Kidnappers}

The player characters spot Hans along with everyone in the group of
bullies who was not arrested by the Constabulary officers. Hans is
carrying his blowpipe with six blue poisoned darts under his coat.
His plan is to make the player characters and Arthur run away, force
them into some narrow, dead-end alley, put Arthur to sleep and take
the boy to the Prussian Consulate at 63 Wolfe Avenue. There, he will
wait for instructions from Berlin. Hans will leave the other children
to the bullies, who will do their best to rob them.

At this time of the day, the Constabulary will not arrive until 1\,sd
turn after somebody is smart enough to shout for help. Once the policemen
arrive, both Hans and the gang of bullies will run away.
\begin{description}
\item [{Note:}] At this point, the adventure has so many options and variants
for the players to try, it is more convenient to structure the adventure
generally in acts. Only the most likely situations are divided into
scenes.
\end{description}

\section{Third Act (A): Prince Arthur escapes}

If Arthur escapes, he will risk his chances sharing the truth with
his new friends. Borgonnia lacks a consulate in New Paris and going
to the embassy in Washington D.C. by train would be expensive and
dangerous. Arthur doesn't want to contact the American authorities
for the reasons explained in the previous act. Their best option is
to try the British Consulate in Concordia at 177 Montcalm Street%
\footnote{Suggested name%
}, ``just around the corner from the Prussian Consulate'' at 63 Wolfe
Avenue. If that fails, he'll beg the players to try again and visit
Miss Abigail Hardpole, his former governess who resides in a small
home near Boston. 

The scenes proposed for this act are not in sequence. Instead, they
should be used as needed.


\section{Scene 6A: The British Consulate}

In a last-ditch effort, Hans will guard the British Consulate, anticipating
the moves of Prince Arthur. Five clerks%
\footnote{Treat them as an ``Average Adult'', see Appendix \vref{cha:A-cast-of}. %
} from the Prussian Consulate are at their disposal. They will try
to block, distract, hold and otherwise keep the player characters
from helping Arthur, while Hans tries to kidnap him again. As a last
resort, he will possibly use red poison. Hans will only resort to
using his guns if his own life is at risk.

A couple of constabularies will come 1\,sd after somebody calls out
for them, causing the clerks to run away. This time Hans will face
the cops to the bitter end.

Once our heroes are able to knock on the door of the British Legation,
it will be opened next turn. It will remain so for 1~fd turns. If
Arthur is able to get in, the Prussians will run away and the player
characters will be safe. If not, the officers of the British Legation
will close the door on the case, assuming it appears to be a street
brawl. The case will not be opened for eight hours.


\section{Scene 7A: Convincing the British Consulate}

Once the players are at the British Consulate, they will be received
by an assistant who will inquire about the fuss outside. The assistant
will appear to be overly skeptical, but will lead the player characters
to the Consulate if they insist, or if the Golden Griffin is shown.

The Consulate will appear to be a very gentle, easygoing man, but
would not believe one single word of the player characters' story.
No matter what they say, or what evidence they bring, the Consulate
is convinced that this is just some childish prank. He will invite
the player characters to leave. If necessary, he will call on the
assistance of the legation staff or even the police if necessary.

After this scene, Arthur will tell the player characters about his
former governess, Miss Abigail Hardpole, who lives in Boston. He will
beg them to go there. Arthur pretty much expects the same reception
in the Borgonnian Embassy. She is his last hope.


\section{Scene 8A: Railroad block}
\begin{description}
\item [{Location:}] West Gate station
\end{description}
The Prussians are not aware of Miss Hardpole, so they would not be
anticipating Arthur's journey to Boston. Nevertheless, they will place
two agents at the West Gate station as it is the most important hub
of communication in New Paris.

They would not dare to kidnap or harm Arthur; instead they will discreetly
investigate their destination and, pretending to be Government agents,
will coerce the train staff to not let the player characters in.

If the player characters try to resist, they will get nothing good
from it. A confrontational attitude would only confirm to the railroad
staff that they are involved in something fishy. This could soon escalate
with the Constabulary men arresting them for misbehavior (a D-rated
crime), resisting arrest (a C-rated crime), or worse.

Their alternatives are to either act as good kids, abandoning the
train to find another way of transportation, or attempt to sneak into
the train. (See scene 9A: ``Getting to Boston'').

If the players try to sneak back onto the train, let them make up
some plan and solve the scene accordingly. Notice, however, that the
Prussian agents will keep an eye out for them. If they are able to
fool both the railroad staff and the Prussian agents they will board
the train, suffering no further complications until they arrive in
Boston. Proceed to ``It all turned out to...''.


\section{Scene 9A: Getting to Boston}

The greatest obstacle the players will have in this scene is desperation.
After the disappointment at the British Consulate and the incident
in the railroad station, the players could feel that everything is
against them. Younger players might need a little reassurance from
the game master, though all they need to win the adventure is to arrive
in Boston.

Their first alternative might be to board some merchant ship or a
fishing boat that is on its way to Boston. Although not impossible,
that would require some research and planning. They may have to stay
for up to 2~nd days until an appropriate ship departs. Even then,
a number of up to 1~wd Prussian agents will be checking the docks
in Old Harbor; twice as many in New Harbor, trying their best to fool
the characters. If the players sail in sight of the agents (six hours
later), the agents will hire a boat two knots faster%
\footnote{Around 3 mph faster.%
} and persecute them at sea.

Their second alternative is simpler: walk to a nearby city and board
a train there, or walk to Boston. Both alternatives would succeed
as long as the players are not being shadowed (see variant 1 and 2)
and as long as the players do nothing that attracts undesired attention.
Proceed to ``It all turned out to...''.


\section{Third Act (B): Arthur is captured}

If Arthur is kidnapped and the players still want to win the adventure,
the thing to do would be to find where Arthur is being held and rescue
him. Up to this time, the player characters cannot be certain of Arthur's
true identity and what is at stake. 


\section{Scene 6B: The investigation}

Defeated, the player characters would regroup near the Newsboy Lodge.
There, they can get medical attention, a loan%
\footnote{Up to \$3 each to be returned in one week.%
} if needed, and more importantly, read the news.

The newspaper reports on the story of the Royal Borgonnian Family's
funeral, which is attended by a host of diplomats, sovereigns and
presidents of nearby countries, including King Edward of the United
Kingdom himself. As a side note, while the whole Royal Family is believed
to have been murdered, the body of young Prince Arthur has not yet
been found. The Borgonnian police reckon that the regicides concealed
his body first, but could not do the same with the rest of the Royals.
His disappearance has caused the delay of the ceremony. A photo of
Arthur, overweight and wearing a Lieutenant's uniform, is printed
to the right of the article.

The Constabulary would never believe that Prince Arthur has been kidnapped
in New Paris, especially from the testimony of a bunch of newsboys;
but let them try if they so wish. The newspapers will be as skeptical
and at most, will publish a small article in their next edition about
a missing French child or a fight among street rats\emph{.} 

If the player characters continue with their mission, their remaining
choice is to investigate the story themselves. Tracking the leads
of Hans would be next to impossible, as passersby would have destroyed
all evidence just by stepping on it. At most, if they spend at least
one hour searching for evidence, an Observation check (TN 13) would
reveal a laundry receipt obtained at Abraham Plains Laundry, in Concordia,
near the consulates of two dozen foreign nations.

Following the lead at Abraham Plains Laundry can produce better results.
Indeed, their best hope is to discreetly ask the staff; one of them
is a boy who has recently arrived from Prussia who will immediately
recognize Hans' accent.

If the player characters decide to go for the bullies, it would take
them at least two hours to investigate; asking in ale houses and similar
places of low repute to learn that they live in a bleak house in the
Inner Expanses, but little else. Befriending them enough so that they
share their stories would take them the rest of the day. Eavesdropping
might be faster, but it would be equally dangerous. In any case, all
they learn is that the bullies were met on the street by the same
German man who asked them about Arthur, and that they believe Arthur
will ``meet de devil fo' dinne' befo' soon.''


\section{Scene 7B: Sneaking in the Prussian Consulate}

The building is a two storey Gothic-looking structure with a cellar
where Arthur is kept, distressed, barely awake and chained to his
bed.

The players have up to 11:00 p.m. on the day after the kidnapping
to save Arthur. At that time, a telegram from Berlin will order Hans
to ``execute the special command''\emph{.} During work hours Hans,
together with the Consulate, one porter, two maids and four clerks,
all staunchly loyal to the Prussian Government, remain and work on
the premises. They will slowly return to their homes at 5 p.m. At
night only Hans, the Consulate and two Prussian agents will remain,
one of who will remain at the cellar door guarding Arthur at all times.

The Consulate lacks special security measures%
\footnote{See variations.%
}; the doors and windows are ordinary and even the main door will only
be closed at night. During office hours, the Consulate proceeds with
its usual operations.

If the players succeed at rescuing Arthur, there could be a short
flight to the British Consulate, as if Arthur had not been kidnapped
(proceed to scene 6A), with just the modifications brought by the
course of action and the story.


\section{\textquotedbl{}It all turned out to...\textquotedbl{} }

Supposing that all goes well and Arthur arrives in Boston, they'll
have the task of finding Miss Hardpole. The game master might choose
to let the first passerby know the location of her home, let the players
do a little investigation (like asking messenger boys, local pastors
or postmen) or convert it into an adventure on its own. However, in
the standard game, Miss Hardpole's home will be just outside Boston,
near enough to the railroad lines that Arthur will be able to see
her from the train.

Once they meet Miss Hardpole, she will take Prince Arthur to the Borgonnian
Embassy in Boston. Heavy diplomatic maneuvers and bribes will keep
the news of the Prussian involvement from slipping into public knowledge
to advert the possibility of a world war, which in the short run,
will be devastating for Borgonnia and in the long run terrible for
Prussia. Instead, Prussia will agree to pay a secret compensation
and order the homicides to be kept on a British prison ship for life.

In two days, newspapers will sell the story that Prince Arthur has
been kidnapped by one of the murderers and taken to Boston, where
he escaped. The culprit is supposed to still be at large.

Prince Arthur will return to his homeland to be cheered by all, and
proclaimed by the Borgonnian House of Commons as Crown Prince and
future King. Arthur will invite his new friends to go with him, (this
time in the HBMS%
\footnote{His Borgonnian Majesty Ship.%
} Audax, the Borgonnian flagship%
\footnote{The Borgonnian Navy has its main base in Antwerp, Borgonnia.%
}), to live in the palace. If the player characters agree, the adventures
are not over, for the Prussian's plots against Borgonnia will continue.
Let them divide three normal dice worth of chit points among their
characters.

If the player characters would rather remain newsies -- which doesn't
seem quite realistic -- let the players divide three sd worth of chit
points among their characters. Add to the lot a contact in the Borgonnian
Embassy. Whenever they are in trouble, or short of money, a telegram
to the Borgonnian Embassy will mean certain, yet perhaps delayed help.


\section{Rumors and variants }


\subsection{Rumors}
\begin{enumerate}
\item D: A slow but ponderous mechanical man guards the Prussian Consulate.
\item E: A ghost appears at the cellar of the Prussian Consulate every Halloween
night. He, she or it has remained undetected, as people rarely go
to the cellar at night.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Variants}
\begin{enumerate}
\item For a more challenging game, have two Prussian agents shadow the player
characters at all times. They will not intervene unless attacked,
if the players abandon the city precincts, or if they go to an area
without witnesses where they make an easy target. In this case the
agents will do their utmost to capture Arthur.
\item D: Let Hans use white poison on player characters.
\item If the players walk to Boston, you might want to add a few small encounters
along the way or even turn it into an adventure itself.
\item Warning Wagners (see ``Bits and notes'' below) could be guarding
the Prussian Consulate.
\item Give any Prussian agent a Mechanical Dragonfly (see ``Bits and notes''
below).
\item When the players arrive in Boston, they discover that Miss Hardpole,
while hiding from Prussian agents, has left them a secret message.
The player characters must decipher that message, find Miss Hardpole,
dodge the Prussian agents and safely arrive at the Borgonnian Consulate.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Bits and notes}

If you want to go a little steampunk, you could add any or both of
the following two cool spy tools:


\subsection*{Mechanical Dragonfly}

Made of silk and thin aluminum, the Mechanical Dragonfly works on
a diminutive gasoline engine. It's equipped with a needle that will
harm no one unless it's loaded, as usual, with up to three doses of
poison.

The Mechanical Dragonfly follows human heat, thanks to a super-science
Prussian heat detector. Ten seconds after being activated, it must
be guided in the general direction of its victim.

In the guise of small bronze Valkyries, these will play an extremely
loud version of a famous Wagner piece if stepped on or touched. Two
of these will be placed on the floor of the Prussian Consulate, right
under the cellar window. If the player characters aren't careful,%

Giant mosquitoes are the most hated residents of New Paris Slums.
With a length of three inches and as voracious as their smaller brethren,
these vampires can turn any night into a nightmare. Giant mosquitoes
are most often found in and around the New Paris Landfill. They prefer
to attack sleeping animals, but when hungry they will take any risk
to fill their abdomens.

\section{Monsters}

This is a list of examples of what could be in stock, should any of
the most uncanny rumors ever be true. These monsters are extremely
rare and they have not ever been seen by any sane person; or if they
were, at least they did not come back to tell their story. As their
very existence is a rumor, the game master should feel free to change
any of their details in any way. Just remember to keep it fair for
players.


\subsection{Zombie}

Zombies will either be working as slaves or guards in the secret hideout
of some mad wizard or doctor%
\footnote{While zombies have a terrible appearance, they are literally crumbling
down in pieces and are a much easier target than in other games. There
is no need the players know this, of course.%
}. 


\subsection{Giant spider}

\end{description}
This monster takes refuge in the sewers and for the most part, eats
cats, small dogs and rodents, though it could attack anybody. The
giant spider is no larger than a dog, though its green poison makes
it dangerous. Once subdued, the victim will be rolled in silk and
then transported to the web for later consumption.

The game master might choose to make the giant spider sentient and
able to speak. In that case, Education and Charisma scores should
be at least 3\,wd, allowing the monster to negotiate with its subdued
human prey, to attain more complex objectives.


\subsection{Apollinarian}

\noindent An E-class rumor
\begin{itemize}
\item Note that there are no stats for Apollinarians; just add 1 sd to the
Charisma score of any creature raised as an Apollinarian.
\end{itemize}
The Apollinarian%
\footnote{I first created the Apollinarian for True20, being a fan of that game,
yet I could not resist adding it here too.%
} is a strange kind of undead creature, created by powerful sorcerers
using a secret ritual on a moribund body. Though an E-class rumor
states that the angst for losing a loved one could also create one.
In any case, death should not be older than two months at the time
of its creation. Once the spell is cast, the body transforms within
hours into the perfect servant.

An Apollinarian resembles the person (or animal) it once was. However,
it is free of any ailments, sickness or other impairments. Moreover,
they are strikingly beautiful and apparently of a young age. Apollinarians
appear to be of any of three ages: 13, 23 or 33. Those who died at
age 12 or younger are ``risen'' as 13 years old, those who died
older than 12 and younger than 34 are ``risen'' as 23 years old
and those who died at 34 or older are ``risen'' as 33 years old. 

If harmed by a weapon they won't bleed, and when smitten or otherwise
``killed'', they will fall to the ground asleep and will not awake
until the ritual is repeated. An Apollinarian can get sick or poisoned,
but if it survives the first 24 hours it will recover instantly by
the next dawn.

An Apollinarian is at all times very polite and warm, never to be
angered, show fear or related emotions, though it could cry in sympathy.
They will obey every command that they receive, and if ordered to
kill or harm someone they will do so with the utmost courtesy for
their victim. They retain the basic skills and knowledge from when
they were living, but again, will only use them as ordered to. 

Apollinarians cannot leave a designated area of roughly one acre or
less. So, they are normally used as laborers and house servants, where
they work without a single complaint for ages. If an Apollinarian
is ever forced out of their area, they will become paralyzed from
the neck down until they are returned. 

Apollinarians only eat ambrosia%
\footnote{Honey mixed with milk.%
}, needing one spoonful per day, otherwise they fall into a deep sleep
until fed.

An Apollinarian can be restored to mortal life by taking it to a church
or other sacred space. Their emotions will return to normal, but they
will retain their appearance. From that point on the Apollinarian
will age normally. Apollinarians will wake up gravely injured, sick,
burned, starved or in other grave conditions as appropriate to the
cause of their first death%
\footnote{As in gravely sick in game terms.%
}.

To change any creature into an Apollinarian, just add 1\,sd to its
Charisma attribute.

China Children look like life-sized porcelain statues of children.
China Children are created by a mysterious sewer virus that slowly
turns the skin of those infected into the palest white. Their hair
falls out and the whole body becomes frail and brittle. The sickness
also affects the victim's behavior, causing them to dread human company
and stay hidden in the sewers. China Children can sleep for months
with no need of nourishment.

Those who touch them or their personal belongings will be infected
if they fail a Health Check (TN 12). There is no known cure.

Adults are more sensitive to the China Virus, dying in hours after
the infection, to rest forever in the likeness of a china statue.

White Ladies appear to be young women, always dressed in delicate
long robes, who come to earth from some spiritual plane. They meet
the player characters, always at night in desolate places. They beg
for favors or some truly heroic and dangerous deed.

If the player characters agree, they will each be given a blessing
(and 3 sd worth of chits). If they refuse, the White Ladies will give
them a white shroud and a miniature tombstone with their names engraved
on it. (Each one of them would lose 1 chit in the process.)

If the player characters ever give up their new quest for more than
one day, the White Ladies will come during the night to lure them
to the cemetery and leave them there, without a single word spoken.
Due to fear and shock, the player characters will lose all their remaining
chits.

is a strange mix of facts with little structure. He could do well
at school and his secret vocation is to lead a congregation some day.

Hook in the Outer Expanses of New Paris City. His dad went west, trying
to find a better future for the family and James hasn\textquoteright{}t
heard from him in two years. His mother died nine months ago. Unable
to pay the rent on his own, James Farrell survives at the Newsboy
Lodge, selling newspapers. He's lucky to have kept his best Sunday
clothes, because that means he can sell the best and most expensive
newspapers. He can go where many other newsboys won\textquoteright{}t
ever be admitted; the Grand Opera House of New Paris being one example.James
dreams of earning admission and a scholarship at some boarding school,
so he can become a \textquotedblleft{}learned, important man\textquotedblright{},
just as his mother advised him while on her death bed. Known as a
nerd and somewhat of a rich boy among other newsies, he wishes to
become a little more popular. Of course, he also wishes to know about
his dad, who he fears could be dead, or much worse. Otherwise, he
strives to spend time with adults, to be popular among them and perhaps
gain a mentor of sorts; that would make his day.
